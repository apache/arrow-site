Python bindings
===============

This is the documentation of the Python API of Apache Arrow. For more details
on the Arrow format and other language bindings see the
:doc:`parent documentation <../index>`.

The Arrow Python bindings (also named "PyArrow") have first-class integration
with NumPy, pandas, and built-in Python objects. They are based on the C++
implementation of Arrow.

Here will we detail the usage of the Python API for Arrow and the leaf
libraries that add additional functionality such as reading Apache Parquet
files into Arrow structures.

Compute Functions
=================

Aggregations
------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   count
   mean
   min_max
   mode
   stddev
   sum
   variance

Arithmetic Functions
--------------------

By default these functions do not detect overflow. Each function is also
available in an overflow-checking variant, suffixed ``_checked``, which 
throws an ``ArrowInvalid`` exception when overflow is detected.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   add
   add_checked
   divide
   divide_checked
   multiply
   multiply_checked
   subtract
   subtract_checked
   power
   power_checked

Comparisons
-----------

These functions expect two inputs of the same type. If one of the inputs is `null`
they return ``null``.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   equal
   greater
   greater_equal
   less
   less_equal
   not_equal

Logical Functions
-----------------

These functions normally emit a null when one of the inputs is null. However, Kleene
logic variants are provided (suffixed ``_kleene``). See User Guide for details.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   and_
   and_kleene
   all
   any
   invert
   or_
   or_kleene
   xor

String Predicates
-----------------

In these functions an empty string emits false in the output. For ASCII 
variants (prefixed ``ascii_``) a string element with non-ASCII characters
emits false in the output.

The first set of functions emit true if the input contains only 
characters of a given class.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   ascii_is_alnum
   ascii_is_alpha
   ascii_is_decimal
   ascii_is_lower
   ascii_is_printable
   ascii_is_space
   ascii_is_upper
   utf8_is_alnum
   utf8_is_alpha
   utf8_is_decimal
   utf8_is_digit
   utf8_is_lower
   utf8_is_numeric
   utf8_is_printable
   utf8_is_space
   utf8_is_upper

The second set of functions also consider the order of characters
in the string element.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   ascii_is_title
   utf8_is_title

The third set of functions examines string elements on 
a byte-by-byte basis.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   string_is_ascii

String Transforms
-----------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   ascii_lower
   ascii_upper
   utf8_lower
   utf8_upper

Containment tests
-----------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   index_in
   is_in
   match_substring
   match_substring_regex

Conversions
-----------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   cast
   strptime

Selections
----------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   filter
   take

Associative transforms
----------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   dictionary_encode
   unique
   value_counts

Sorts and partitions
--------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   partition_nth_indices
   sort_indices

Structural Transforms
---------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/

   binary_length
   fill_null
   is_null
   is_valid
   list_value_length
   list_flatten
   list_parent_indices

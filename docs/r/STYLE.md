## Referring to external packages

When referring to external packages, include a link to the package at
the first mention, and subsequently refer to it in plain text, e.g.

-   “The arrow R package provides a
    [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) interface to Arrow Datasets.
    This article introduces Datasets and shows how to use dplyr to
    analyze them.”

## Data frames

When referring to the concept, use the phrase “data frame”, whereas when
referring to an object of that class or when the class is important,
write `data.frame`, e.g.

-   “You can call `write_dataset()` on tabular data objects such as
    Arrow Tables or RecordBatches, or R data frames. If working with
    data frames you might want to use a `tibble` instead of a
    `data.frame` to take advantage of the default behaviour of
    partitioning data based on grouped variables.”

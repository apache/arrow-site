## Apache Arrow Project Governance

The Arrow project is a part of the Apache Software Foundation and follows
its [project management guidelines](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#management),
which promote community-led consensus decisionmaking,
[independent](https://community.apache.org/projectIndependence.html) of
commercial influence.

### Project Management Committee (PMC)

The [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc-members)
governs the project. Members [vote](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html)
on important decisions, including releases and inviting committers to join the PMC.

<table class="table table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Affiliation</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
  {% assign sorted_committers = site.data.committers | sort: "name" %}
  {% for person in sorted_committers %}
    {% if person.role == "VP" %}
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid={{ person.alias }}">{{ person.name }}</a> (Chair)</td>
    <td>{{ person.affiliation }}</td>
  </tr>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  {% for person in sorted_committers %}
    {% if person.role == "PMC" %}
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid={{ person.alias }}">{{ person.name }}</a></td>
    <td>{{ person.affiliation }}</td>
  </tr>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</tbody></table>

### Committers

Contributors who have demonstrated a sustained commitment to the
project may be invited by the PMC to become
[committers](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#committers).
Committers are authorized to merge code patches to the project's
repositories and serve as non-voting project maintainers. See the
"Becoming a committer" section below for more details.

<table class="table table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Affiliation</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
  {% assign sorted_committers = site.data.committers | sort: "name" %}
  {% for person in sorted_committers %}
    {% if person.role == "Committer" %}
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid={{ person.alias }}">{{ person.name }}</a></td>
    <td>{{ person.affiliation }}</td>
  </tr>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</tbody></table>

### Becoming a committer

There are many ways to [contribute](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html)
to the Apache Arrow project, including issue reports,
documentation, tests, and code. Contributors with sustained, high-quality activity
may be invited to become committers by the PMC
as a recognition of their sustained
contribution to the project. A committer can commit
changes directly in all Arrow GitHub repositories, and have the significant responsibility
of using their status and access to improve the Arrow project
for the entire community.

When considering to invite someone to be a committer, the PMC looks for
contributors who are doing the work and exercising the judgment expected
of a committer already. After all, any contributor can do all of the things a
committer does except for merge a PR. While there is no set list of
requirements, nor a checklist that entitles one to commit privileges,
typical behaviors include:

* Contributions beyond pull requests, such as reviewing other pull requests,
  fixing bugs and documentation, triaging issues, answering community
  questions, improving usability, reducing technical debt, helping
  with CI, verifying releases, debugging in strange environments, etc.

* These contributions to the project should be consistent in quality
  and sustained over time, typically on the order of 6 months or more.

* Assistance growing the size and health of the community via
  constructive, respectful, and consensus driven interactions, as
  described in our [Code of Conduct] and [the Apache Way].

The mechanics of how the process works is [documented here].  If you
feel you should be offered committer privileges, but have not been,
you can reach out to one of the PMC members or the `private@arrow.apache.org`
mailing list.

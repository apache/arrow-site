<meta name="description" content="The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 12.0.0 release. This covers over 3 months of development work and includes 476 resolved issues with 531 commits from 97 distinct contributors. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the complete changelog. Community Since the 11.0.0 release, Wang Mingming, Mustafa Akur and Ruihang Xia have been invited to be committers. Will Jones have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC). Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! Columnar Format Notes A first “canonical” extension type has been formalized: arrow.fixed_shape_tensor to represent an Array where each slot contains a tensor, with all tensors having the same dimension and shape, GH-33923. This is based on a Fixed-Size List layout as storage array (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#fixed-shape-tensor-extension). Arrow Flight RPC notes The JDBC driver for Arrow Flight SQL has had some bugfixes, and has been refactored into a core library (which is not distributed as an uberjar with shaded names) and a driver (which is distributed as an uberjar). The Java server builder API now offers easier access to the underlying gRPC builder. Go now implements the Flight SQL extensions for Substrait and transaction support. Plasma notes Plasma was deprecated since 10.0.0. Plasma is removed in this release. GH-33243 Linux packages notes We dropped support for Ubuntu 18.04 because Ubuntu 18.04 reached EOL.

Python notes Compatibility notes: Plasma has been removed in this release (GH-33243). In addition, the deprecated serialization module in PyArrow was also removed (GH-29705). IPC (Inter-Process Communication) functionality of pyarrow or the standard library pickle should be used instead. The deprecated use_async keyword has been removed from the dataset module (GH-30774) Minimum Cython version to build PyArrow from source has been raised to 0.29.31 (GH-34933).

<p>A first “canonical” extension type has been formalized: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrow.fixed_shape_tensor</code> to
represent an Array where each slot contains a tensor, with all tensors having the same
dimension and shape, <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33923">GH-33923</a>.
This is based on a Fixed-Size List layout as storage array
(<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#fixed-shape-tensor-extension">https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#fixed-shape-tensor-extension</a>).</p>

<h2 id="arrow-flight-rpc-notes">Arrow Flight RPC notes</h2>

<p>The JDBC driver for Arrow Flight SQL has had some bugfixes, and has been refactored into a core library (which is not distributed as an uberjar with shaded names) and a driver (which is distributed as an uberjar).</p>

<p>The Java server builder API now offers easier access to the underlying gRPC builder.</p>

<p>Go now implements the Flight SQL extensions for Substrait and transaction support.</p>

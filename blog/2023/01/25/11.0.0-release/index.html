Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! Columnar Format Notes Arrow Flight RPC notes In the C++/Python Flight clients, DoAction now properly streams the results, instead of blocking until the call finishes. Applications that did not consume the iterator before should fully consume the result. (#15069) C++ notes It is now possible to specify alignment when making allocations with a MemoryPool GH-33056 It is now possible to run an ExecPlan without using any CPU threads Added kernel for slicing list values GH-33168 Added kernel for slicing binary arrays GH-20357 When comparing list arrays for equality the list field name is now ignored GH-30519 Add support for partitioning on columns that contain special characters GH-33448 Added a streaming reader for JSON GH-33140 Added support for incremental writes to the ORC writer GH-33047 Added support for casting decimal to string and writing decimal to CSV GH-33002 Fixed an assert in the scanner that would occur when batch_readahead was set to 0 GH-15264 Fixed bug where arrays with a null data buffer would not be accepted when imported via the C data API GH-14875 Fixed bug where arrays with a zero-case union data type would not be accepted when imported via the C data API GH-14855 Fixed bug where case_when could return incorrect values GH-33382 Fixed bug where RecordBatch::Equals was ignoring field names GH-33285 C# notes No major changes to C#. Go notes Go’s benchmarks will now get added to Conbench alongside the benchmarks for other implementations GH-32983 Exposed FlightService_ServiceDesc and RegisterFlightServiceServer to allow easily incorporating a flight service into an existing gRPC server GH-15174 Arrow Function ApproxEquals was implemented for scalar values GH-29581 UnmarshalJSON for the RecordBuilder now properly handles extra unknown fields with complex/nested values GH-31840 Decimal128 and Decimal256 type support has been added to the CSV reader GH-33111 Fixed bug in array.UnionBuilder where Len method always returned 0 GH-14775 Fixed bug for handling slices of Map arrays when marshalling to JSON and for IPC GH-14780 Fixed memory leak when compressing IPC message body buffers GH-14883 Added the ability to easily append scalar values to array builders GH-15005 Compute Scalar binary (add/subtract/multiply/divide/etc.) and unary arithmetic (abs/neg/sqrt/sign/etc.) has been implemented for the compute package GH-33086 this includes easy functions like compute.Add and compute.Divide etc. Scalar boolean functions like AND/OR/XOR/etc. have been implemented for compute GH-33279 Scalar comparison function kernels have been implemented for compute (equal/greater/greater_equal/less/less_equal) GH-33308 Scalar compute functions are compatible with dictionary encoded arrays by casting them to their value types GH-33502 Parquet Panic when decoding a delta_bit_packed encoded column has been fixed GH-33483 Fixed memory leak from Allocator in pqarrow.WriteArrowToColumn GH-14865 Fixed writer.WriteBatch to properly handle writing encrypted parquet columns and no longer silently fail, but instead propagate an error GH-14940 Java notes Implement support for writing compressed files (#15223) Improve performance by short-circuiting null checks when comparing non null field types (#15106) Several enhancements to dictionary encoding (#14891, (#14902, (#14874) Extend Table to support additional vector types (#14573) Enhance and simplify handling of allocation management by integrating C Data into allocator hierarchy (#14506) Make ComplexCopier agnostic of specific implementation of MapWriter (#14557) Distribute Apple M1 compatible JNI libraries via mavencentral (#14472) Extend Table copy functionality, and support returning copies of individual vectors (#14389) JavaScript notes Bugfixes and dependency updates. Arrow now requires BigInt support. GH-33681 Python notes Compatibility notes: PyArrow now requires pandas &gt;= 1.0 (ARROW-18173) The pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset() class now by default uses the new Dataset API under the hood (use_legacy_dataset=False). You can still pass use_legacy_dataset=True to get the legacy implementation, but this option will be removed in a next release (ARROW-16728). New features: Added support for the DataFrame Interchange Protocol for pyarrow.Table (GH-33346). New kernels: list_slice() to slice each list element of a ListArray returning a new ListArray (ARROW-17960). A new filter() method on the Dataset class as additional API to filter a Dataset before consuming it (ARROW-16616). New sort() method for (Chunked)Array and sort_by() method for RecordBatch, providing a convenience on top of the sort_indices kernel (GH-14778), and a new Dataset.sort_by() method (GH-14975). Other improvements: Support for custom metadata of record batches in the IPC read and write APIs (ARROW-16430). Support URIs and the filesystem parameter in pyarrow.parquet.ParquetFile (ARROW-18272) and pyarrow.parquet.write_metadata (ARROW-18225). When writing a dataset to IPC using pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset(), you can now specify IPC specific options, such as compression (ARROW-17991) The pyarrow.array() function now allows to construct a MapArray from a sequence of dicts (in addition to a sequence of tuples) (ARROW-17832). The struct_field() kernel now also accepts field names in addition to integer indices (ARROW-17989). Casting to string is now supported for duration (ARROW-15822) and decimal (ARROW-17458) types, which also means those can now be written to CSV. When writing to CSV, you can now specify the quoting style (GH-14755). The pyarrow.ipc.read_schema() function now accepts a Message object (ARROW-18423). The Time32Scalar, Time64Scalar, Date32Scalar and Date64Scalar classes got a .value attribute to access the underlying integer value, similar to the other date-time related scalars (ARROW-18264) Duration type is now supported in the hash kernels like dictionary_encode (GH-15226). Fix silent overflow when converting datetime.timedelta to duration type (ARROW-15026). Relevant bug fixes: Numpy conversion for ListArray is improved taking into account sliced offset, avoiding increased memory usage (GH-20512 Fix writing files with multi-byte characters in file name (ARROW-18123). R notes map_batches() is lazy by default; it now returns a RecordBatchReader instead of a list of RecordBatch objects unless lazy = FALSE. GH-14521 A substantial reorganisation, rewrite of and addition to, many of the vignettes and README. GH-14514 For more on what’s in the 11.0.0 R package, see the R changelog. Ruby and C GLib notes Ruby Arrow::Table#save now always returns self instead of the result of its raw_recordsGH-15289 Improve the GC-related crash prevention system by guarding the shared objects from GC ARROW-18161 Add Arrow::HalfFloat and raw_records support in Arrow::HalfFloatArray ARROW-18086 Support omitting join keys in Table#join GH-15084 Add support for Arrow::Table.load(uri, schema:) ARROW-15206 Add Arrow::ColumnContainable#column_names (e.g. Arrow::Table#column_names) GH-15085 Add to_arrow_chunked_array methods to support converting to Arrow::ChunkedArray ARROW-18405 C GLib Add garrow_chunked_array_new_empty() GH-33671 Add GArrowProjectNodeOptions GH-33670 Add GADatasetHivePartitioning GH-15257 The signature of garrow_execute_plain_wait() was changed to take the error argument and to return the finished status GH-15254 Add support for half float GH-15168 Add GADatasetFinishOptions GH-15146 Rust notes The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories outside the main Arrow monorepo.

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dataset.sort_by()</code> method (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14975">GH-14975</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for custom metadata of record batches in the IPC read and write APIs
(<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16430">ARROW-16430</a>).</li>

  <li>When writing a dataset to IPC using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset()</code>, you can now
specify IPC specific options, such as compression
(<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17991">ARROW-17991</a>)</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.array()</code> function now allows to construct a MapArray from a sequence of
dicts (in addition to a sequence of tuples)
(<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17832">ARROW-17832</a>).</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct_field()</code> kernel now also accepts field names in addition to integer
indices (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17989">ARROW-17989</a>).</li>
  <li>Casting to string is now supported for duration (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15822">ARROW-15822</a>)

which also means those can now be written to CSV.</li>
  <li>When writing to CSV, you can now specify the quoting style

For the full list of new features with their relevant PRs, see the enhancements section in the changelog. async planning and decoupling file format from table layout Driven by the need to support Hive style table partitioning, @rdettai introduced the following design change to the Datafusion core. The code for reading specific file formats (Parquet, Avro, CSV, and JSON) was separated from the logic that handles grouping sets of files into execution partitions. The query planning process was made async. As a result, we are able to replace the old Parquet, CSV and JSON table providers with a single ListingTable table provider. This also sets up DataFusion and its plug-in ecosystem to supporting a wide range of catalogs and various object store implementations. You can read more about this change in the design document and on the arrow-datafusion#1010 PR. How to Get Involved If you are interested in contributing to DataFusion, we would love to have you! You can help by trying out DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and filing bug reports and helping to improve the documentation, or contribute to the documentation, tests or code.

<h1 id="async-planning-and-decoupling-file-format-from-table-layout"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> planning and decoupling file format from table layout</h1>

<p>Driven by the need to support Hive style table partitioning, @rdettai
introduced the following design change to the Datafusion core.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code for reading specific file formats (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parquet</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Avro</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSV</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code>) was separated from the logic that handles grouping sets of
files into execution partitions.</li>
  <li>The query planning process was made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, we are able to replace the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parquet</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSV</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> table
providers with a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ListingTable</code> table provider.</p>

<p>This also sets up DataFusion and its plug-in ecosystem to
supporting a wide range of catalogs and various object store implementations.
You can read more about this change in the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bd4-PLLH-pHj0BquMDsJ6cVr_awnxTuvwNJuWsTHxAQ">design document</a>

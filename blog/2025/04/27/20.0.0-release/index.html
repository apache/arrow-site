<meta name="description" content="The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 20.0.0 release. This release covers over 2 months of development work and includes 259 resolved issues on 327 distinct commits from 63 distinct contributors. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the complete changelog. Community Since the 19.0.0 release, Ed Seidl, Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Matthijs Brobbel have been invited to become committers. Bryce Mecum, Ian Cook, Jacob Wujciak-Jens and Rok Mihevc have been invited to join the Project Management Committee (PMC). Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! C++ Notes Compute We’ve added several new compute functions: inverse_permutation/scatter (GH-44393), pivot_wider/hash_pivot_wider (GH-45269), rank_normal (GH-45572), skew/kurtosis (GH-45676), and winsorize (GH-45755). Acero We&#39;ve significantly improved the Hash Join in terms of overflow-safety (GH-44513, GH-45334, GH-45506), memory consumption (peak memory usage reduced by half: GH-45551), and performance (up to several dozen times faster: GH-45611, GH-45917). Flight RPC The experimental Flight over UCX feature has been removed. (#43296) C# Notes Added support for the Ordered and AppMetaData fields to FlightInfo (#45753) FlightClient can now be integrated with Grpc.Net.ClientFactory (#45451) Linux Packaging Notes https://apache.jfrog.io/ is still available but https://packages.apache.org/ is preferred because the latter uses the apache.org domain. Python Notes Compatibility notes: Minimum supported Cython has been raised to 3 and higher GH-45237 . A subset of deprecated APIs have been removed GH-45680: PARQUET_2_0 GH-45848, use_legacy_dataset GH-44790, serialize/deserialize PyArrow C++ code GH-43587 . New features: Large variable width types are supported in NumPy conversion GH-35289. Biased/unbiased option are available in skew and kurtosis compute functions GH-45733. Support for SAS token in the AzureFileSystem has been added GH-45705. Interchange of decimal32, decimal64 and decimal256 data type objects between Pandas and PyArrow is now supported GH-45582, GH-45570. pyarrow.ArrayStatisticsand pyarrow.Array.statistics() are added GH-45457. Bindings for JSON streaming reader are added GH-14932. Bindings for MemoryPool::total_bytes_allocated and MemoryPool::num_allocations are added. Also allocator-specific statistics can now be printed to stderr GH-45358. A new maps_as_pydictsparameter is introduced to to_pylist, to_pydict and as_py methods enabling deserialization into Python dictionary instead of list of tuples GH-39010. Other improvements: Source (sdist) and binary distribution (wheels) are now uploaded to GitHub Releases GH-45920. Cython code has been cleaned up as we now require at least Cython 3.0 GH-45433. Building of free-threaded wheels on Windows is enabled GH-44421 . *Wheels for Alpine Linux are now provided GH-18036 . Relevant bug fixes: Pandas conversion roundtrip with bytes column names error is fixed GH-44188. Exceptions are raised instead of showing segfaults when users try to instantiate internal Parquet metadata classes GH-36628. R Notes Binary Arrays now inherit from blob::blob in addition to arrow_binary when converted to R objects. This change is the first step in eventually deprecating the arrow_binary class in favor of the blob class in the blob package (See GH-45709). Ruby and C GLib Notes Improvements garrow_array_validate() / Arrow::Array#validate: Added. GH-45328 garrow_array_validate_full() / Arrow::Array#validate_full: Added. GH-45342 garrow_record_batch_validate() / Arrow::RecordBatch#validate: Added. GH-45353 garrow_record_batch_validate_full() / Arrow::RecordBatch#validate_full: Added. GH-45386 garrow_table_validate() / Arrow::Table#validate: Added. GH-45414 garrow_table_validate_full() / Arrow::Table#validate_full: Added. GH-45468 GArrowArrayStatistics() / Arrow::ArrayStatistics: Added. GH-45490 Changed to require Meson 0.61.2 or later. GArrowBinaryViewArray() / Arrow::BinaryViewArray: Added. GH-45650 GArrowStringViewArray() / Arrow::StringViewArray: Added. GH-45711 Added support for rubygems-requirements-system GH-45976 Incompatible changes gparquet_arrow_file_writer_new_row_group() / Parquet:ArrowFileWriter#new_row_group: Removed chunk_size argument. GH-45088 garrow_record_batch_new() / Arrow::RecordBatch#initialize: Stopped validating automatically. If you want to validate a created record batch, call garrow_record_batch_validate() / Arrow::RecordBatch#validate explicitly. GH-45353 garrow_table_new() / Arrow::Table#initialize: Stopped validating automatically. If you want to validate a created table, call garrow_table_validate() / Arrow::Table#validate explicitly. GH-45414 Java, Go, and Rust Notes The Java, Go, and Rust Go projects have moved to separate repositories outside the main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Java implementation, see the latest Arrow Java changelog. For notes on the latest release of the Rust implementation see the latest Arrow Rust changelog. For notes on the latest release of the Go implementation, see the latest Arrow Go changelog." />

This change is the first step in eventually deprecating the <code>arrow_binary</code>

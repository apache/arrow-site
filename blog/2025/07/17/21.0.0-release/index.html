<meta name="description" content="The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 21.0.0 release. This release covers over 2 months of development work and includes 339 resolved issues on 400 distinct commits from 82 distinct contributors. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the complete changelog. Community Since the 20.0.0 release, Alenka Frim has been invited to join the Project Management Committee (PMC). Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! The Call for Speakers for the Apache Arrow Summit 2025 is now open! The Summit will take place on October 2nd, 2025 in Paris, France as part of PyData Paris. The call will be open until July 26, 2025. Please see the Call for Speakers link to submit a talk or the developer mailing list for more information. Arrow Flight RPC Notes In C++ and Python, a new IPC reader option was added to force data buffers to be aligned based on the data type, making it easier to work with systems that expected alignment (GH-32276). While this is not a Flight-specific option, it tended to occur with Flight due to implementation details. Also, C++ and Python are now consistent with other Flight implementations in allowing the schema of a FlightInfo to be omitted (GH-37677). We have accepted a donation of an ODBC driver for Flight SQL from Dremio (GH-46522). Note that the driver is not usable in its current state and contributors are working on implementing the rest of the driver. C++ Notes Compute The Cast function is now able to reorder fields when casting from one struct type to another; the fields are matched by name, not by index (GH-45028). Many compute kernels have been moved into a separate, optional, shared library (GH-25025). This improves modularity for dependency management in the application and reduces the Arrow C++ distribution size when the compute functionality is not being used. Note that some compute functions, such as the Cast function, will still be built for internal use in various Arrow components. Better half-float support has been added to some compute functions: is_nan, is_inf, is_finite, negate, negate_checked, sign (GH-45083); if_else, case_when, coalesce, choose, replace_with_mask, fill_null_forward, fill_null_backward (GH-37027); run_end_encode, run_end_decode (GH-46285). Better decimal32 and decimal64 support has been added to some compute functions: run_end_encode, run_end_decode (GH-46285). A new function utf8_zero_fill acts like Python&#39;s str.zfill method by providing a left-padding function that preserves the optional leading plus/minus sign (GH-46683). Decimal sum aggregation now produces a decimal result with an increased precision in order to reduce the risk of overflowing the result type (GH-35166). CSV Reading Duration columns is now supported (GH-40278). Dataset It is now possible to preserve order when writing a dataset multi-threaded. The feature is disabled by default (GH-26818). Filesystems The S3 filesystem can optionally be built into a separate DLL (GH-40343). Parquet Encryption A new SecureString class must now be used to communicate sensitive data (such as secret keys) with Parquet encryption APIs. This class automatically wipes its contents from memory when destroyed, unlike regular std::string (GH-31603). Type support The new VARIANT logical type is supported at a low level, and an extension type parquet.variant is added to reflect such columns when reading them to Arrow (GH-45937). The UUID logical type is automatically converted to/from the arrow.uuid canonical extension type when reading or writing Parquet data, respectively. The GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY logical types are supported (GH-45522). They are automatically converted to/from the corresponding GeoArrow extension type, if it has been registered by GeoArrow. Geospatial column statistics are also supported. It is now possible to read BYTE_ARRAY columns directly as LargeBinary or BinaryView, without any intermediate conversion from Binary. Similarly, those types can be written directly to Parquet (GH-43041). This allows bypassing the 2 GiB data per chunk limitation of the Binary type, and can also improve performance. This also applies to String types when a Parquet column has the STRING logical type. Similarly, LIST columns can now be read directly as LargeList rather than List. This allows bypassing the 2^31 values per chunk limitation of regular List types (GH-46676). Other Parquet improvements A new feature named Content-Defined Chunking improves deduplication of Parquet files with mostly identical contents, by choosing data page boundaries based on actual contents rather than a number of values. For that, it uses a rolling hash function, and the min and max chunk size can be chosen. The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled on a per-file basis in the Parquet WriterProperties (GH-45750). The EncodedStatistics of a column chunk are publicly exposed in ColumnChunkMetaData and can be read faster than if decoded as Statistics (GH-46462). SIMD optimizations for the BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT have been improved (GH-46788). Reading FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY data has been made significantly faster (up to 3x faster on some benchmarks). This benefits logical types such as FLOAT16 (GH-43891). Miscellaneous C++ changes The ARROW_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS build option was removed, as CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD usually provides more benefits while requiring less maintenance. New data creation helpers ArrayFromJSONString, ChunkedArrayFromJSONString, DictArrayFromJSONString, ScalarFromJSONString and DictScalarFromJSONString are now exposed publicly. While not as high-performing as BufferBuilder and the concrete ArrayBuilder subclasses, they allow easy creation of test or example data, for example: ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE( auto string_array, arrow::ArrayFromJSONString(arrow::utf8(), R&quot;([&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, null])&quot;)); ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE( auto list_array, arrow::ArrayFromJSONString(arrow::list(arrow::int32()), &quot;[[1, null, 2], [], [3]]&quot;)); Some APIs were changed to accept std::string_view instead of const std::string&amp;. Most uses of those APIs should not be affected (GH-46551). A new pretty-print option allows limiting element size when printing string or binary data (GH-46403). It is now possible to export Tensor data using DLPack (GH-39294). Half-float arrays can be properly diff&#39;ed and pretty-printed (GH-36753). Some header files in arrow/util that were not supposed to be exposed are now made internal (GH-46459). C# Notes The C# Arrow implementation is being extracted from the Arrow monorepo into a standalone repository to allow it to have its own release cadence. See the mailing list for more information. This is the final release of the Arrow monorepo that will include the the C# implementation. Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust Notes The Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust Go projects have moved to separate repositories outside the main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Java implementation, see the latest Arrow Java changelog. For notes on the latest release of the JavaScript implementation, see the latest Arrow JavaScript changelog. For notes on the latest release of the Rust implementation see the latest Arrow Rust changelog. For notes on the latest release of the Go implementation, see the latest Arrow Go changelog. Linux Packaging Notes We added support for AlmaLinux 10. You can use AlmaLinux 10 packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 like distributions too. We dropped support for CentOS Stream 8 because it reached EOL on 2024-05-31. MATLAB Notes New Features Added support for creating an arrow.tabular.Table from a list of arrow.tabular.RecordBatch instances (GH-46877) Packaging The MLTBX available in apache/arrow&#39;s GitHub Releases area was built against MATLAB R2025a. Python Notes Compatibility notes: Deprecated PyExtensionType has been removed (GH-46198). Deprecated use_legacy_formathas been removed in favour of setting IpcWriteOptions (GH-46130). Due to SciPy 1.15&#39;s stricter sparse code changes are made to pa.SparseCXXMatrix constructors and pa.SparseCXXMatrix.to_scipy methods with migrating from scipy.spmatrix to scipy.sparray (GH-45229). New features: PyArrow does not require NumPy anymore to generate float16 scalars and arrays (GH-46611). pc.utf8_zero_fill is now available in the compute module imitating Pythonâ€™s `str.zfill`` (GH-46683). pa.arange utility function is now available which creates an array of evenly spaced values within a given interval (GH-46771). Scalar subclasses are now implementing Python protocols (GH-45653). It is possible now to specify footer metadata when opening IPC file for writing using metadata keyword in pa.ipc.new_file() (GH-46222). DLPack is now implemented (export) on the Tensor class in C++ and available in Python (GH-39294). Other improvements: Couple of improvements have been included in the Filesystems module: Filesystem operations are more convenient to users by supporting explicit fsspec+{protocol} and hf:// filesystem URIs (GH-44900), ConfigureManagedIdentityCredential and ConfigureClientSecretCredential have been exposed to AzureFileSystem (GH-46833), allow_delayed_open (GH-45957) and tls_ca_file_path (GH-40754) have been exposed to S3FileSystem. Parquet module improvements include: mapping of logical types to Arrow extension types by default (GH-44500), UUID extension type conversion support when writing or reading to/from Parquet (GH-43807) and support for uniform encryption when writing parquet files by exposing EncryptionConfiguration.uniform_encryption (GH-38914). filter_expression is exposed in Table.join and Dataset.join to support filtering rows when performing hash joins with Acero (GH-46572). dim_names argument can now be passed to from_numpy_ndarray constructor (GH-45531). Relevant bug fixes: pyarrow.Table.to_struct_array failure when the table is empty has been fixed (GH-46355). Filtering all rows with RecordBatch.filter using an expression now returns empty table with same schema instead of erroring (GH-44366). Ruby and C GLib Notes A number of changes were made in the 21.0.0 release which affect both Ruby and C GLib: Added support for fixed shape tensor extension data type. Added support for UUID extension data type. Added support for fixed size list data type. Added support for the Arrow C data interface for chunked array. Added support for distinct count in array statistics. Ruby There were no update only for Ruby. C GLib You must call garrow_compute_initialize() explicitly before you use computation related features." />

New features: PyArrow does not require NumPy anymore to generate float16 scalars and arrays (GH-46611). pc.utf8_zero_fill is now available in the compute module imitating Pythonâ€™s `str.zfill`` (GH-46683). pa.arange utility function is now available which creates an array of evenly spaced values within a given interval (GH-46771). Scalar subclasses are now implementing Python protocols (GH-45653). It is possible now to specify footer metadata when opening IPC file for writing using metadata keyword in pa.ipc.new_file() (GH-46222). DLPack is now implemented (export) on the Tensor class in C++ and available in Python (GH-39294). Other improvements: Couple of improvements have been included in the Filesystems module: Filesystem operations are more convenient to users by supporting explicit fsspec+{protocol} and hf:// filesystem URIs (GH-44900), ConfigureManagedIdentityCredential and ConfigureClientSecretCredential have been exposed to AzureFileSystem (GH-46833), allow_delayed_open (GH-45957) and tls_ca_file_path (GH-40754) have been exposed to S3FileSystem. Parquet module improvements include: mapping of logical types to Arrow extension types by default (GH-44500), UUID extension type conversion support when writing or reading to/from Parquet (GH-43807) and support for uniform encryption when writing parquet files by exposing EncryptionConfiguration.uniform_encryption (GH-38914). filter_expression is exposed in Table.join and Dataset.join to support filtering rows when performing hash joins with Acero (GH-46572). dim_names argument can now be passed to from_numpy_ndarray constructor (GH-45531). Relevant bug fixes: pyarrow.Table.to_struct_array failure when the table is empty has been fixed (GH-46355). Filtering all rows with RecordBatch.filter using an expression now returns empty table with same schema instead of erroring (GH-44366). Ruby and C GLib Notes A number of changes were made in the 21.0.0 release which affect both Ruby and C GLib: Added support for fixed shape tensor extension data type. Added support for UUID extension data type. Added support for fixed size list data type. Added support for the Arrow C data interface for chunked array. Added support for distinct count in array statistics. Ruby There were no update only for Ruby. C GLib You must call garrow_compute_initialize() explicitly before you use computation related features.","headline":"Apache Arrow 21.0.0 Release","image":"https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_horizontal_black-txt_white-bg.png","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2025/07/17/21.0.0-release/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://arrow.apache.org/img/logo.png"},"name":"pmc"},"url":"https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2025/07/17/21.0.0-release/"}</script>

-->
<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 21.0.0 release. This release
covers over 2 months of development work and includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/milestone/69?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>339 resolved
issues</strong></a> on <a href="/release/21.0.0.html#contributors"><strong>400 distinct commits</strong></a> from <a href="/release/21.0.0.html#contributors"><strong>82 distinct
contributors</strong></a>. See the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/install/">Install Page</a> to
learn how to get the libraries for your platform.</p>
<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the <a href="/release/21.0.0.html#changelog">complete changelog</a>.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Since the 20.0.0 release, Alenka Frim has been invited to join the Project
Management Committee (PMC).</p>
<p>Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sessionize.com/arrow-summit-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call for Speakers</a> for the
Apache Arrow Summit 2025 is now open! The Summit will take place on October 2nd,
2025 in Paris, France as part of <a href="https://pydata.org/paris2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyData Paris</a>.
The call will be open until July 26, 2025. Please see the <a href="https://sessionize.com/arrow-summit-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call for
Speakers</a> link to submit a talk or
the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/f0vcbtpzg6rntzbvmjstyd27bd9qfhl0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer mailing
list</a> for more
information.</p>
<h2>Arrow Flight RPC Notes</h2>
<p>In C++ and Python, a new IPC reader option was added to force data buffers to be
aligned based on the data type, making it easier to work with systems that
expected alignment (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/32276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-32276</a>).
While this is not a Flight-specific option, it tended to occur with Flight due
to implementation details. Also, C++ and Python are now consistent with other
Flight implementations in allowing the schema of a <code>FlightInfo</code> to be omitted
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-37677</a>).</p>
<p>We have accepted a donation of an ODBC driver for Flight SQL from Dremio
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46522</a>). Note that the driver
is not usable in its current state and contributors are working on implementing
the rest of the driver.</p>
<h2>C++ Notes</h2>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<p>The Cast function is now able to reorder fields when casting from one struct
type to another; the fields are matched by name, not by index
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-45028</a>).</p>
<p>Many compute kernels have been moved into a separate, optional, shared library
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/25025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-25025</a>). This improves
modularity for dependency management in the application and reduces the Arrow
C++ distribution size when the compute functionality is not being used. Note
that some compute functions, such as the Cast function, will still be built for
internal use in various Arrow components.</p>
<p>Better half-float support has been added to some compute functions: <code>is_nan</code>,
<code>is_inf</code>, <code>is_finite</code>, <code>negate</code>, <code>negate_checked</code>, <code>sign</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-45083</a>); <code>if_else</code>,
<code>case_when</code>, <code>coalesce</code>, <code>choose</code>, <code>replace_with_mask</code>, <code>fill_null_forward</code>,
<code>fill_null_backward</code> (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-37027</a>);
<code>run_end_encode</code>, <code>run_end_decode</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46285</a>).</p>
<p>Better decimal32 and decimal64 support has been added to some compute functions:
<code>run_end_encode</code>, <code>run_end_decode</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46285</a>).</p>
<p>A new function <code>utf8_zero_fill</code> acts like Python's <code>str.zfill</code> method by
providing a left-padding function that preserves the optional leading plus/minus
sign (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46683</a>).</p>
<p>Decimal sum aggregation now produces a decimal result with an increased
precision in order to reduce the risk of overflowing the result type
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-35166</a>).</p>
<h3>CSV</h3>
<p>Reading Duration columns is now supported
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-40278</a>).</p>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>It is now possible to preserve order when writing a dataset multi-threaded. The
feature is disabled by default
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/26818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-26818</a>).</p>
<h3>Filesystems</h3>
<p>The S3 filesystem can optionally be built into a separate DLL
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-40343</a>).</p>
<h3>Parquet</h3>
<h4>Encryption</h4>
<p>A new <code>SecureString</code> class must now be used to communicate sensitive data (such
as secret keys) with Parquet encryption APIs. This class automatically wipes its
contents from memory when destroyed, unlike regular <code>std::string</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/31603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-31603</a>).</p>
<h4>Type support</h4>
<p>The new VARIANT logical type is supported at a low level, and an extension type
<code>parquet.variant</code> is added to reflect such columns when reading them to Arrow
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-45937</a>).</p>
<p>The UUID logical type is automatically converted to/from the <code>arrow.uuid</code>
canonical extension type when reading or writing Parquet data, respectively.</p>
<p>The GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY logical types are supported
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-45522</a>). They are
automatically converted to/from the corresponding GeoArrow extension type, if it
has been registered by GeoArrow. Geospatial column statistics are also
supported.</p>
<p>It is now possible to read BYTE_ARRAY columns directly as LargeBinary or
BinaryView, without any intermediate conversion from Binary. Similarly, those
types can be written directly to Parquet
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-43041</a>). This allows
bypassing the 2 GiB data per chunk limitation of the Binary type, and can also
improve performance. This also applies to String types when a Parquet column has
the STRING logical type.</p>
<p>Similarly, LIST columns can now be read directly as LargeList rather than List.
This allows bypassing the 2^31 values per chunk limitation of regular List types
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46676</a>).</p>
<h4>Other Parquet improvements</h4>
<p>A new feature named Content-Defined Chunking improves deduplication of Parquet
files with mostly identical contents, by choosing data page boundaries based on
actual contents rather than a number of values. For that, it uses a rolling hash
function, and the min and max chunk size can be chosen. The feature is disabled
by default and can be enabled on a per-file basis in the Parquet
<code>WriterProperties</code> (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-45750</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>EncodedStatistics</code> of a column chunk are publicly exposed in
<code>ColumnChunkMetaData</code> and can be read faster than if decoded as <code>Statistics</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46462</a>).</p>
<p>SIMD optimizations for the BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT have been improved
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46788</a>).</p>
<p>Reading FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY data has been made significantly faster (up to 3x
faster on some benchmarks). This benefits logical types such as FLOAT16
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-43891</a>).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous C++ changes</h3>
<p>The <code>ARROW_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS</code> build option was removed, as
<code>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</code> usually provides more benefits while requiring less
maintenance.</p>
<p>New data creation helpers <code>ArrayFromJSONString</code>, <code>ChunkedArrayFromJSONString</code>,
<code>DictArrayFromJSONString</code>, <code>ScalarFromJSONString</code> and <code>DictScalarFromJSONString</code>
are now exposed publicly. While not as high-performing as <code>BufferBuilder</code> and
the concrete <code>ArrayBuilder</code> subclasses, they allow easy creation of test or
example data, for example:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Some APIs were changed to accept <code>std::string_view</code> instead of <code>const std::string&amp;</code>. Most uses of those APIs should not be affected
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46551</a>).</p>
<p>A new pretty-print option allows limiting element size when printing string or
binary data (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46403</a>).</p>
<p>It is now possible to export <code>Tensor</code> data using
<a href="https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLPack</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-39294</a>).</p>
<p>Half-float arrays can be properly diff'ed and pretty-printed
(<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-36753</a>).</p>
<p>Some header files in <code>arrow/util</code> that were not supposed to be exposed are
now made internal (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH-46459</a>).</p>

# TL;DR
DuckDB is rapidly becoming an essential part of data practitioners' toolbox, finding use cases in data engineering, machine learning, and local analytics. In many cases DuckDB has been used to query and process data that has already been saved to storage (file-based or external database) by another process. Arrow Database Connectivit...

この記事はデータベースとクエリーエンジン間のデータ交換フォーマットとしてなぜArrowが使われているのかという謎を解くシリーズの最初の記事です。

「どうしてこんなに時間がかかるの？」
これはデータを扱っている人がクエリー結果を待っている間によく考える質問です。たくさんの回答が考えられます。もしかしたら、データソースが適切にパーティショニングされていないかもしれません。もしかしたら、SaaSのデータウェアハウスのリソースが足りないのかもしれません。もしかしたら、クエリーオプティマイザーがSQL文を効率的な実行計画に落とし込めなかったのかもしれません。
しかし、驚くほど多くの場合、クエリ結果をクライアントに転送するために非効率なプロトコルを使っていることが答えになります。2017年の論...

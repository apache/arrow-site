<meta name="description" content="The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.5.0 release. It includes 130 resolved JIRAs with some new features, expanded integration testing between implementations, and bug fixes. The Arrow memory format remains stable since the 0.3.x and 0.4.x releases. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The complete changelog is also available. Expanded Integration Testing In this release, we added compatibility tests for dictionary-encoded data between Java and C++. This enables the distinct values (the dictionary) in a vector to be transmitted as part of an Arrow schema while the record batches contain integers which correspond to the dictionary. So we might have: data (string): [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;] In dictionary-encoded form, this could be represented as: indices (int8): [0, 1, 0, 1] dictionary (string): [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;] In upcoming releases, we plan to complete integration testing for the remaining data types (including some more complicated types like unions and decimals) on the road to a 1.0.0 release in the future. C++ Activity We completed a number of significant pieces of work in the C++ part of Apache Arrow. Using jemalloc as default memory allocator We decided to use jemalloc as the default memory allocator unless it is explicitly disabled. This memory allocator has significant performance advantages in Arrow workloads over the default malloc implementation. We will publish a blog post going into more detail about this and why you might care. Sharing more C++ code with Apache Parquet We imported the compression library interfaces and dictionary encoding algorithms from the Apache Parquet C++ library. The Parquet library now depends on this code in Arrow, and we will be able to use it more easily for data compression in Arrow use cases. As part of incorporating Parquet’s dictionary encoding utilities, we have developed an arrow::DictionaryBuilder class to enable building dictionary-encoded arrays iteratively. This can help save memory and yield better performance when interacting with databases, Parquet files, or other sources which may have columns having many duplicates. Support for LZ4 and ZSTD compressors We added LZ4 and ZSTD compression library support. In ARROW-300 and other planned work, we intend to add some compression features for data sent via RPC. Python Activity We fixed many bugs which were affecting Parquet and Feather users and fixed several other rough edges with normal Arrow use. We also added some additional Arrow type conversions: structs, lists embedded in pandas objects, and Arrow time types (which deserialize to the datetime.time type). In upcoming releases we plan to continue to improve Dask support and performance for distributed processing of Apache Parquet files with pyarrow. The Road Ahead We have much work ahead of us to build out Arrow integrations in other data systems to improve their processing performance and interoperability with other systems. We are discussing the roadmap to a future 1.0.0 release on the developer mailing list. Please join the discussion there." />

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.5.0 release. It includes
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.5.0"><strong>130 resolved JIRAs</strong></a> with some new features, expanded integration
testing between implementations, and bug fixes. The Arrow memory format remains
stable since the 0.3.x and 0.4.x releases.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://arrow.apache.org/install">Install Page</a> to learn how to get the libraries for your
platform. The <a href="http://arrow.apache.org/release/0.5.0.html">complete changelog</a> is also available.</p>

<h2 id="expanded-integration-testing">Expanded Integration Testing</h2>

<p>In this release, we added compatibility tests for dictionary-encoded data
between Java and C++. This enables the distinct values (the <em>dictionary</em>) in a
vector to be transmitted as part of an Arrow schema while the record batches
contain integers which correspond to the dictionary.</p>

<p>So we might have:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data (string): ['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In dictionary-encoded form, this could be represented as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>indices (int8): [0, 1, 0, 1]
dictionary (string): ['foo', 'bar']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In upcoming releases, we plan to complete integration testing for the remaining
data types (including some more complicated types like unions and decimals) on
the road to a 1.0.0 release in the future.</p>

<h2 id="c-activity">C++ Activity</h2>

<p>We completed a number of significant pieces of work in the C++ part of Apache
Arrow.</p>

<h3 id="using-jemalloc-as-default-memory-allocator">Using jemalloc as default memory allocator</h3>

<p>We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">jemalloc</a> as the default memory allocator unless it is
explicitly disabled. This memory allocator has significant performance
advantages in Arrow workloads over the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">malloc</code> implementation. We will
publish a blog post going into more detail about this and why you might care.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-more-c-code-with-apache-parquet">Sharing more C++ code with Apache Parquet</h3>

<p>We imported the compression library interfaces and dictionary encoding
algorithms from the <a href="http://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp">Apache Parquet C++ library</a>. The Parquet library now
depends on this code in Arrow, and we will be able to use it more easily for
data compression in Arrow use cases.</p>

<p>As part of incorporating Parquet’s dictionary encoding utilities, we have
developed an <code class="highlighter-rouge">arrow::DictionaryBuilder</code> class to enable building
dictionary-encoded arrays iteratively. This can help save memory and yield
better performance when interacting with databases, Parquet files, or other
sources which may have columns having many duplicates.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-lz4-and-zstd-compressors">Support for LZ4 and ZSTD compressors</h3>

<p>We added LZ4 and ZSTD compression library support. In ARROW-300 and other
planned work, we intend to add some compression features for data sent via RPC.</p>

<h2 id="python-activity">Python Activity</h2>

<p>We fixed many bugs which were affecting Parquet and Feather users and fixed
several other rough edges with normal Arrow use. We also added some additional
Arrow type conversions: structs, lists embedded in pandas objects, and Arrow
time types (which deserialize to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime.time</code> type).</p>

<p>In upcoming releases we plan to continue to improve <a href="http://github.com/dask/dask">Dask</a> support and
performance for distributed processing of Apache Parquet files with pyarrow.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>We have much work ahead of us to build out Arrow integrations in other data
systems to improve their processing performance and interoperability with other
systems.</p>

<p>We are discussing the roadmap to a future 1.0.0 release on the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/">developer
mailing list</a>. Please join the discussion there.</p>

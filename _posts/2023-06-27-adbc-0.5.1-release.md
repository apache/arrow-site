The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.5.1 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**8
resolved issues**][1] from [**8 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
0.5.1.  The **API specification** is versioned separately and is
at version 1.0.0.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

This is a patch release primarily aimed at fixing a [deadlock in the Snowflake driver][6] that was discovered post-release.

## Roadmap

Work for the proposed [1.1.0 API revision][adbc-api-1.1.0] is progressing on a [branch][adbc-api-1.1.0-branch], with several API proposals merged in and others awaiting review.  They will then receive prototype implementations before being submitted for review/voting.  This is not currently targeting any release of the ADBC libraries, although we hope to wrap up this effort in the next few months.

A milestone has been created to explore [asynchronous APIs][adbc-api-1.2.0], which have been requested for a while now.

## Getting Involved

We welcome questions and contributions from all interested.  Issues
can be filed on [GitHub][4], and questions can be directed to GitHub
or the [Arrow mailing lists][5].

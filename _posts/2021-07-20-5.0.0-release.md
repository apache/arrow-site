The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 4.0.0 release, Daniël Heres, Kazuaki Ishizaki, Dominik Moritz, and Weston Pace
have been invited as committers to Arrow,
and Benjamin Kietzman and David Li have joined the Project Management Committee
(PMC). Thank you for all of your contributions!

## Columnar Format Notes

Official IANA Media types (MIME types) have been registered for Apache
Arrow IPC protocol data, both [stream]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-streaming-format) and [file]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format) variants:

* https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream
* https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.apache.arrow.file

We recommend ".arrow" as the IPC file format file extension and ".arrows" for the IPC streaming format file extension.

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

The Go implementation now supports custom metadata and middleware, and has been added to integration testing.

In Python, some operations can now be interrupted via Control-C.

## C++ notes

## C# notes

## Go notes

## Java notes

## JavaScript notes

* Tables do not extend DataFrames anymore. This enables smaller bundles. [#10277](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10277)
* Arrow uses closure compiler for all UMD bundles, making them smaller. [#10281](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10281)
* The npm package now comes with declaration maps for better navigation from types to source code. [#10673](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10673)
* Updated dependencies and improvements to the code.

## Python notes

* Datasets can now scan files asynchronously when the `use_async=True` option is provided to `Dataset.scanner`, `Dataset.to_table`, or `Dataset.to_batches` methods. This should provide better performance in environments where I/O can be slow, such as with remote sources.
* Arrow now provides builtin support for writing CSV files through `pyarrow.csv.write_csv`
* Wheels for Apple M1 Macs are now provided.
* Many new `pyarrow.compute` functions are available, and introspection of the functions was improved so that they look more like standard Python functions.
* It is now possible to access ORC file metadata from Python `ORCFile` objects
* Building a `StructArray` now accepts a `mask` like other arrays
* Many updates and fixes for the documentation

## R notes

In this release, we've more than doubled the number of functions you can call on Arrow Datasets inside `dplyr::filter()` and `mutate()`, including many more string, datetime, and math functions. You can also write Datasets to CSV files, in addition to Parquet and Feather. We've also deepened support for the Arrow C interface, which is used in the Python interface and allows integration with other projects, such as DuckDB.

For more on what’s in the 5.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

The [run-end encoded layout](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Columnar.html#run-end-encoded-layout)
has been added.  This layout can allow data with long runs of duplicate values to be encoded and processed
efficiently.  Initial support has been added for [C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14179) and
[Go](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14223).

### C Device Data Interface

An **experimental** new specification, the
[C Device Data Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html),
has been accepted for inclusion (GH-34971). It builds on the existing
C Data Interface to provide a runtime-agnostic zero-copy sharing mechanism
for Arrow data residing on non-CPU devices.

Reference implementations of the C Device Data Interface will progressively
be added to the standard Arrow libraries after the 13.0.0 release.

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

Support for flagging ordered result sets to clients is now added. ([#34852](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34852))

gRPC 1.30 is now the minimum supported version in C++/Python/R/etc. ([#34679](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36479)) 

In C++, various methods now receive a full `ServerCallContext` ([#35442](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35442), [#35377](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35377)) and the context now exposes headers sent by the client ([#35375](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35375)).

## C++ notes

### Building

CMake 3.16 or later is now required for building Arrow C++ (GH-34921).

Optimizations are not disabled anymore when the `RelWithDebInfo` build type
is selected (GH-35850). Furthermore, compiler flags can now properly be
customized per-build type using `ARROW_C_FLAGS_DEBUG`, `ARROW_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG`
and related variables (GH-35870).

### Acero

Handling of unaligned buffers is input nodes can be configured programmatically
or by setting the environment variable `ACERO_ALIGNMENT_HANDLING`. The default
behavior is to warn when an unaligned buffer is detected (GH-35498).

### Compute

Several new functions have been added:
* aggregate functions "first", "last", "first_last" (GH-34911);
* vector functions "cumulative_prod", "cumulative_min", "cumulative_max" (GH-32190);
* vector function "pairwise_diff" (GH-35786).

Sorting now works on dictionary arrays, with a much better performance than
the naive approach of sorting the decoded dictionary (GH-29887). Sorting also
works on struct arrays, and nested sort keys are supported using `FieldRed` (GH-33206).

The `check_overflow` option has been removed from `CumulativeSumOptions` as
it was redundant with the availability of two different functions:
"cumulative_sum" and "cumulative_sum_checked" (GH-35789).

Run-end encoded filters are efficiently supported (GH-35749).

Duration types are supported with the "is_in" and "index_in" functions (GH-36047).
They can be multiplied with all integer types (GH-36128).

"is_in" and "index_in" now cast their inputs more flexibly: they first attempt
to cast the value set to the input type, then in the other direction if the
former fails (GH-36203).

Multiple bugs have been fixed in "utf8_slice_codeunits" when the `stop` option
is omitted (GH-36311).

### Dataset

A custom schema can now be passed when writing a dataset (GH-35730). The custom
schema can alter nullability or metadata information, but is not allowed to
change the datatypes written.

### Filesystems

The S3 filesystem now writes files in equal-sized chunks, for compatibility with
Cloudflare's "R2" Storage (GH-34363).

A long-standing issue where S3 support could crash at shutdown because of resources
still being alive after S3 finalization has been fixed (GH-36346). Now, attempts
to use S3 resources (such as making filesystem calls) after S3 finalization should
result in a clean error.

The GCS filesystem accepts a new option to set the project id (GH-36227).

### IPC

Nullability and metadata information for sub-fields of map types is now preserved
when deserializing Arrow IPC (GH-35297).

### Orc

The Orc adapter now maps Arrow field metadata to Orc type attributes when writing,
and vice-versa when reading (GH-35304).

### Parquet

It is now possible to write additional metadata while a `ParquetFileWriter` is
open (GH-34888).

Writing a page index can be enabled selectively per-column (GH-34949).
In addition, page header statistics are not written anymore if the page
index is enabled for the given column (GH-34375), as the information would
be redundant and less efficiently accessed.

Parquet writer properties allow specifying the sorting columns (GH-35331).
The user is responsible for ensuring that the data written to the file
actually complies with the given sorting.

CRC computation has been implemented for v2 data pages (GH-35171).
It was already implemented for v1 data pages.

Writing compliant nested types is now enabled by default (GH-29781). This
should not have any negative implication.

Attempting to load a subset of an Arrow extension type is now forbidden
(GH-20385). Previously, if an extension type's storage is nested (for example
a "Point" extension type backed by a `struct<x: float64, y: float64>`),
it was possible to load selectively some of the columns of the storage type.

### Substrait

Support for various functions has been added: "stddev", "variance", "first",
"last" (GH-35247, GH-35506).

Deserializing sorts is now supported (GH-32763). However, some features,
such as clustered sort direction or custom sort functions, are not
implemented.

### Miscellaneous

`FieldRef` sports additional methods to get a flattened version of nested
fields (GH-14946). Compared to their non-flattened counterparts,
the methods `GetFlattened`, `GetAllFlattened`, `GetOneFlattened` and
`GetOneOrNoneFlattened` combine a child's null bitmap with its ancestors'
null bitmaps such as to compute the field's overall logical validity bitmap.

In other words, given the struct array `[null, {'x': null}, {'x': 5}]`,
`FieldRef("x")::Get` might return `[0, null, 5]`
while `FieldRef("y")::GetFlattened` will *always* return `[null, null, 5]`.

`Scalar::hash()` has been fixed for sliced nested arrays (GH-35360).

A new floating-point to decimal conversion algorithm exhibits much better
precision (GH-35576).

It is now possible to cast between scalars of different list-like types
(GH-36309).

## C# notes

### Enhancements

* The [C Data Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html) is now supported in the .NET Apache.Arrow library. The main entry points are `CArrowArrayImporter.ImportArray`, `CArrowArrayExporter.ExportArray`, `CArrowArrayStreamImporter.ImportArrayStream`, and `CArrowArrayStreamExporter.ExportArrayStream` in the `Apache.Arrow.C` namespace.

* `ValueStr` method on Timestamp arrays now includes the zone in the output ([GH-36568](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36568))

* `array.ApproxEqual` for Maps now allows entries for a given element to be presented in any order ([GH-35828](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35828))

## Java notes

The JNI bindings for Arrow Dataset now support execute [Substrait](https://substrait.io/) plans via the [Acero](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/cpp/streaming_execution.html) query engine. ([#34223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34223))

Arrow packages that depend on Netty (most notably, `arrow-memory-netty`, but also Arrow Flight) now require Netty 4.1.94.Final at a minimum. ([#36209](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36209))

`VectorSchemaRoot#slice` now always makes a copy, including when the slice covers all rows (previously it did not make a copy in this case). This is a potentially-breaking change if your application depended on the old behavior. ([#35275](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35275))

Debug info for allocations is no longer automatically enabled when assertions are enabled (e.g. when running unit tests). Instead, support must be explicitly enabled. This is not quite a breaking change, but may be surprising if you are used to using this information while debugging tests. However, performance should be greatly improved while running tests. ([#34338](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34338))

Support for the upcoming Java 21 was added, though we do not yet test this in CI ([#5053](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35053)). The JNI bindings for Arrow Dataset now expose JSON support ([#36421](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36421)). Dictionary replacement is now supported when writing the IPC stream format ([#18547](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/18547)).

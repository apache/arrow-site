The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the version 15 release 
of the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This release includes [**31
resolved issues**][1] from [**13 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
15.  The [**API specification**][specification] is versioned 
separately and is at version 1.1.0.

The subcomponents are versioned independently:

- C/C++/GLib/Go/Python/Ruby: 1.3.0
- C#: 0.15.0
- Java: 0.15.0
- R: 0.15.0
- Rust: 0.15.0

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

- The BigQuery driver is now properly released to PyPI. See 
  [adbc-driver-bigquery](https://pypi.org/project/adbc-driver-bigquery/).```
- A basic driver for Apache DataFusion is now being developed.
- The documentation now includes the Doxygen API reference for C/C++, which should give a better/more native experience than the previous Breathe-based documentation.
- The Java libraries now use the latest arrow-java libraries, and as such require Java 11 or newer.
- The PostgreSQL driver has basic support for Redshift, though it cannot use the COPY optimizations for PostgreSQL and as such will not be as fast.
- The PostgreSQL driver can now handle ingesting Arrow list types.
- The PostgreSQL driver will use the [Opaque canonical extension type][opaque] for unknown types, instead of just returning bytes with no further context.
- We no longer build for Python 3.8.  We now build for Python 3.13.
- The Snowflake driver better handles catalog operations when not connected to a particular database.

## Roadmap

There is some discussion on a potential second revision of ADBC to include more missing functionality and asynchronous API support.  For more, see the [milestone](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/8); the proposed C Data Interface extensions have been accepted.

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**46
resolved issues**][1] from [**9 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version 0.6.0.
The **API specification** is versioned separately and is at version
1.0.0.  (The API version will be updated to 1.1.0 in the coming
release.)

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

The PostgreSQL and SQLite drivers have better type support.  The
PostgreSQL driver will also chunk its output now instead of always
delivering a single record batch.  The Snowflake driver no longer
requires a URI to connect.  The Python driver manager and Flight SQL
driver deliver more concise error messages, with less fluff around the
actual error message delivered by the database.

A critical bugfix for all Go-based drivers (Flight SQL and Snowflake)
is included.  This fixes panics caused by uninitialized memory in C
Data Interface structures appearing to the garbage collector as
(invalid) pointers to Go memory.  For details, see [issue
729][gh-729].

While C♯ is not yet included in this release, the library is now more
compatible with .NET 4.

## Roadmap

The 1.1.0 revision of the ADBC API was accepted, but is not included
in this release.  It will be released as ADBC 0.7.0.

There are currently no plans for a second API revision.  As work
progresses on asynchronous and device-aware APIs in the Arrow
ecosystem, ADBC will eventually be updated to support any new APIs.

## Getting Involved

We welcome questions and contributions from all interested.  Issues
can be filed on [GitHub][4], and questions can be directed to GitHub
or the [Arrow mailing lists][5].

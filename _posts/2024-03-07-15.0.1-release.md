The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 15.0.1 release.
This is mostly a bugfix release that includes [**42 resolved issues**][1]
from [**18 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## C++ notes

Several bug fixes, please see the full changelog for details.

## Java notes

Fixed a regression in Arrow Java v15.0.0 affecting the arrow-dataset module on Linux. The Protobuf library dependency was not statically linked properly, resulting in an undefined symbol. The regression caused the program to crash at runtime. See [GH-39919](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39919) for more details.

* Fix leaking references to Numpy dtypes ([GH-39599](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39599))
* Fix except clauses in order to be compatible with Cython 3.0.9 ([GH-40386](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40386))

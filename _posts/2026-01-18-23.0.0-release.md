## Community

As per our newly started tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year
Antoine Pitrou was elected as the new PMC chair and VP, succeeding
Neal Richardson.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Arrow Flight RPC Notes

An ODBC driver for Apache Arrow Flight SQL has been completed.  Currently it is not packaged for release, but [can be built from source](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-23.0.0/cpp/src/arrow/flight/sql/odbc/README.md).

Larsson.

### Ruby

Experimental Pure Ruby Apache Arrow reader implementation has been
added as `red-arrow-format` gem.

See also: [GH-48132](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/48132)

We'll add experimental writer implementation in the next release.

`Arrow::Column#to_arrow{,_array,_chunked_array}` have been added. They
are for convenient.

See also: [GH-48292](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/48292)

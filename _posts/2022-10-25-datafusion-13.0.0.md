# Introduction

[Apache Arrow DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) [`13.0.0`](https://crates.io/crates/datafusion) is released, and this blog contains an update on the project for the 5 months since our [last update in May 2022](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/05/16/datafusion-8.0.0/).

DataFusion is an extensible and embeddable query engine, written in Rust used to create modern, fast and efficient data pipelines, ETL processes, and database systems. You may want to check out DataFusion to extend your Rust project to:

- Support [SQL support](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/sql_status.html)
- Support [DataFrame API](https://docs.rs/datafusion/13.0.0/datafusion/dataframe/struct.DataFrame.html)
- Support a Domain Specific Query Language
- Easily and quickly read and process Parquet, JSON, Avro or CSV data.
- Read from remote object stores such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP.

Even though DataFusion is 4 years "young," it has seen significant community growth in the last few months and the momentum continues to accelerate.

# Background


DataFusion is used as the engine in [many open source and commercial projects](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion#known-uses) and was one of the early open source projects to provide this capability. 2022 has validated our belief in the need for such a ["LLVM for database and AI systems"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iNX_35sWUakee2q3zMFPyHE4IV2nC3lkCK_H6Y2qK84/edit#slide=id.p) with announcements such as the [release of FaceBook's Velox](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/08/31/open-source/velox/) engine, the major investments in [Acero](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/streaming_execution.html) as well as the continued popularity of [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) and other similar technologies.

While Velox and Acero focus on execution engines, DataFusion provides the entire suite of components needed to build most analytic systems, including a SQL frontend, a dataframe API, and  extension points for just about everything. Some [DataFusion users](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion#known-uses) use a subset of the features such as the frontend (e.g. [dask-sql](https://dask-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) or the execution engine, (e.g.  [Blaze](https://github.com/blaze-init/blaze)), and some use many different components to build both SQL based and customized DSL based systems such as [InfluxDB IOx](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/pulls) and [VegaFusion](https://github.com/vegafusion/vegafusion).

One of DataFusion’s advantages is its implementation in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and thus its easy integration with the broader Rust ecosystem. Rust continues to be a major source of benefit, from the [ease of parallelization with the high quality and standardized `async` ecosystem](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/using-rustlangs-async-tokio-runtime-for-cpu-bound-tasks/) , as well as its modern dependency management system and wonderful performance. <!-- I wonder if we should link to clickbench?? -->
<!--While we haven’t invested in the benchmarking ratings game datafusion continues to be quite speedy (todo quantity this, with some evidence) – maybe clickbench?-->

Maybe we can do this un a future post
# DataFusion in Action

While DataFusion really shines as an embeddable query engine, if you want to try it out and get a feel for its power, you can use the basic[`datafusion-cli`](https://docs.rs/datafusion-cli/13.0.0/datafusion_cli/) tool to get a sense for what is possible to add in your application

(TODO example here of using datafusion-cli to query from local parquet files on disk)

TODO: also mention you can use the same thing to query data from S3
-->


# Summary

We have increased the frequency of DataFusion releases to monthly instead of quarterly. This
makes it easier for the increasing number of projects that now depend on DataFusion.

We have also completed the "graduation" of [Ballista to its own top-level arrow-ballista repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista)
which decouples the two projects and allows each project to move even faster.

Along with numerous other bug fixes and smaller improvements, here are some of the major advances:

# Improved Support for Cloud Object Stores

DataFusion now supports many major cloud object stores (Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage) "out of the box" via the [object_store](https://crates.io/crates/object_store) crate. Using this integration, DataFusion optimizes reading parquet files by reading only the parts of the files that are needed.


## Advanced SQL

DataFusion now supports correlated subqueries, by rewriting them as joins. See the [Subquery](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/subqueries.html) page in the User Guide for more information.

In addition to numerous other small improvements, the following SQL features are now supported:

- `ROWS`, `RANGE`, `PRECEDING` and `FOLLOWING` in `OVER` clauses [#3570]
- `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` grouping set expressions  [#2446]
- `SUM DISTINCT` aggregate support  [#2405]
- `IN` and `NOT IN` Subqueries by rewriting them to `SEMI` / `ANTI` [#2421] [#2885]
- Non equality predicates in  `ON` clause of  `LEFT`, `RIGHT, `and `FULL` joins [#2591]
- Exact `MEDIAN` [#3009]
- `GROUPING SETS`/`CUBE`/`ROLLUP` [#2716]

# More DDL Support

Just as it is important to query, it is also important to give users the ability to define their data sources. We have added:

 - `CREATE VIEW` [#2279]
 - `DESCRIBE <table>` [#2642]
 - Custom / Dynamic table provider factories [#3311]
 - `SHOW CREATE TABLE` for support for views [#2830]

# Faster Execution
Performance is always an important goal for DataFusion, and there are a number of significant new optimizations such as

 - Optimizations of TopK (queries with a `LIMIT` or `OFFSET` clause):  [#3527], [#2521]
 - Reduce `left`/`right`/`full` joins to `inner` join [#2750]
 - Convert  cross joins to inner joins when possible [#3482]
 - Sort preserving `SortMergeJoin` [#2699]
 - Improvements in group by and sort performance [#2375]
 - Adaptive `regex_replace` implementation [#3518]

# Optimizer Enhancements
Internally the optimizer has been significantly enhanced as well.

- Casting / coercion now happens during logical planning [#3185] [#3396] [#3636]
- More sophisticated expression analysis and simplification is available

# Parquet
 - The parquet reader can now read directly from parquet files on remote object storage [#2489] [#2677] [#3051]
 - Experimental support for “predicate pushdown” with late materialization after filtering during the scan (another blog post on this topic is coming soon).
 - Support reading directly from AWS S3 and other object stores via `datafusion-cli ` [#3631]

# DataType Support
- Support for `TimestampTz` [#3660]
- Expanded support for the `Decimal` type, including  `IN` list and better built in coercion.
- Expanded support for date/time manipulation such as  `date_bin` built-in function , timestamp `+/-` interval, `TIME` literal values [#3010], [#3110], [#3034]
- Binary operations (`AND`, `XOR`, etc):  [#3037] [#1619] [#3420] [#3430]
- `IS TRUE/FALSE` and `IS [NOT] UNKNOWN` [#3235], [#3246]

## Upcoming Work
With the community growing and code accelerating, there is so much great stuff on the horizon. Some features we expect to land in the next few months:

- [Complete Parquet Pushdown](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/3462)
- [Additional date/time support](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/3148)
- Cost models, Nested Join Optimizations, analysis framework [#128], [#3843], [#3845]


# Community Growth


The DataFusion 9.0.0 and 13.0.0 releases consists of 433 PRs from 64 distinct contributors. This does not count all the work that goes into our dependencies such as [arrow](https://crates.io/crates/arrow),  [parquet](https://crates.io/crates/parquet), and [object_store](https://crates.io/crates/object_store), that much of the same community helps nurture.

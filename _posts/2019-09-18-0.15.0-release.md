The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.15.0 release. This
covers over 2 months of development work and includes [**N resolved
issues**][1] from [**N distinct contributors**][2].  See the Install
Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The
[complete changelog][3] is also available.

This post will give some brief highlights in the project since the
0.14.0 release in July.

## New committers

Since the 0.14.0 release, we've added four new committers:

* [Ben Kietzman][4]
* [David Li][5]
* [Kenta Murata][6]
* [Neal Richardson][7]

In addition, [Sebastien Binet][8] and [Micah Kornfield][9] have join the PMC.

Thank you for all your contributions!

## TODO: Add key topics


## Columnar Format Notes

The format gets new datatypes : LargeList(ARROW-4810), LargeBinary and
LargeString (ARROW-750).  LargeList is similar to List but with 64-bit
offsets instead of 32-bit.  The same relationship holds for LargeBinary
and LargeString with respect to Binary and String.

TODO comment on IPC changes.

## Arrow Flight notes

A getFlightSchema method is added to the Flight RPC protocol (ARROW-6094).
As the name suggests, it returns the schema for a given Flight descriptor
on the server.  This is useful for cases where the Flight locations are
not immediately available, depending on the server implementation.

Flight implementations for C++ and Java now implement half-closed
semantics for DoPut (ARROW-6063).  The client can close the writing
end of the stream to signal that it has finished sending the Flight
data, but still receive the batch-specific response and its associated
metadata.

## C++ notes

C++ now supports the LargeList, LargeBinary and LargeString datatypes.

The Status class gains the ability to carry additional subsystem-specific
data with it, under the form of an opaque StatusDetail interface (ARROW-4036).
This allows, for example, to store not only an exception message coming from
Python but the actual Python exception object, such as to raise it again if
the Status is propagated back to Python.  It can also enable the consumer
of Status to inspect the subsystem-specific error, such as a finer-grained
Flight error code.

DataType and Schema equality are significantly faster (ARROW-6038).

### CSV reader

The CSV reader is now more flexible in terms of how column names are chosen
(ARROW-6231) and column selection (ARROW-5977).

### Memory layer

Arrow now has the option to allocate memory using the mimalloc memory
allocator.  jemalloc is still preferred for best performance, but mimalloc
is a reasonable alternative to the system allocator on Windows where jemalloc
is not currently supported.

Also, we now expose explicit global functions to get a MemoryPool for each
of the jemalloc allocator, mimalloc allocator and system allocator (ARROW-6292).

The vendored jemalloc version is bumped from 4.5.x to 5.2.x (ARROW-6549).
Performance characteristics may differ on memory allocation-heavy workloads,
though we did not notice any significant regression on our suite of
micro-benchmarks (and a multi-threaded benchmark of reading a CSV file
showed a 25% speedup).

### Filesystem layer

A S3 FileSystem implementation is now available.  It depends on the AWS SDK
for C++.

### I/O layer

Significant improvements were made to the Arrow I/O stack.

* ARROW-6180: Add RandomAccessFile::GetStream that returns an InputStream over
  a fixed subset of the file.
* ARROW-6381: Improve performance of small writes with BufferOutputStream
* ARROW-2490: Streamline concurrency semantics of InputStream implementations,
  and add debug checks for race conditions between non-thread-safe InputStream
  operations.
* ARROW-6527: Add an OutputStream::Write overload that takes an owned Buffer
  rather than a raw memory area.  This allows OutputStream implementations
  to safely implement delayed writing without having to copy the data.

### Tensors

TODO

## C# Notes


## Go notes


## Java notes

* Added an initial version of an Avro adapter
* To improve the JDBC adapter performance, refactored consume data logic and implemented an iterator API to prevent loading all data into one vector
* Implemented subField encoding for complex type, now List and Struct vectors subField encoding is available
* Implemented visitor API for vector/range/type/approx equals compare
* Performed a lot of optimization and refactoring for DictionaryEncoder, supporting all data types and avoiding memory copy via hash table and visitor API
* Introduced [Error Prone][10] into code base to catch more potential errors earlier
* Fixed the bug where dictionary entries were required in IPC streams even when empty; readers can now also read interleaved messages

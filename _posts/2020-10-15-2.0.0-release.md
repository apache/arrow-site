The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 2.0.0 release. This covers
over XX months of development work and includes [**XX resolved issues**][1]
from [**XX distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes
For Arrow Flight, 2.0.0 mostly brings bugfixes. In Java, some memory leaks in `FlightStream` and `DoPut` have been addressed. In C++ and Python, a deadlock has been fixed in an edge case. Additionally, when supported by gRPC, TLS verification can be disabled.
## C++ notes

## C# notes

## Go notes

## Java notes
The Java package has supported a number of new features. 
Users can validate vectors in a wider range of aspects, if they are willing to take more time. 
In dictionary encoding, dictionary indices can be expressed as unsinged integers.
A framework for data compression has been setup for IPC.  

The calculation for vector capacity has been simplified, so users should experience notable performance
improvements for various 'setSafe' methods. 

Bugs for JDBC adapters, sort algorithms, and ComplexCopier have been resolved to make them more usable.
## JavaScript notes

## Python notes

The `pyarrow.filesystem` submodule is deprecated in favor of new filesystem
implementations in `pyarrow.fs`.

The custom serialization functionality (`pyarrow.serialize()`,
`pyarrow.deserialize()`, etc) is deprecated. Those functions provided a
Python-specific (not cross-language) serialization format which were not
compatible with the standardized Arrow (IPC) serialization format.  
For arbitrary objects, you can use the standard library ``pickle``
functionality instead. For pyarrow objects, you can use the IPC
serialization format through the ``pyarrow.ipc`` module, as explained
above.

The `pyarrow.compute` module now has a complete coverage of the available C++
compute kernels in the python API. Several new kernels have been added (... TODO
list a few ...).

The `pyarrow.dataset` module was further improved. In addition to reading,
it is now also possible to write partitioned datasets (with `write_dataset()`).

The Arrow <-> Python conversion code was refactored, fixing several bugs
and corner cases.


## R notes


For more on whatâ€™s in the 2.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

In Ruby binding, `Arrow::Table#save` uses the number of rows as the `chunk_size` parameter by default when the table is saved in a Parquet file.

### C GLib

The GLib binding newly supports `GArrowStringDictionaryArrayBuilder` and `GArrowBinaryDictionaryArrayBuilder`.

Moreover the GLib binding supports new accessors of `GArrowListArray` and `GArrowLargeListArray`.  They are `get_values`, `get_value_offset`, `get_value_length`, and `get_value_offsets`.

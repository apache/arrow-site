The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 11.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**423 resolved issues**][1]
from [**95 distinct contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 10.0.0 release, Ben Baumgold, Will Jones, Eric Patrick Hanson,
Curtis Vogt, Yang Jiang, Jarrett Revels, Raúl Cumplido, Jacob Wujciak,
Jie Wen and Brent Gardner have been invited to be committers.
Kun Liu have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).

As per our newly started tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year
Andrew Lamb was elected as the new PMC chair and VP.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

In the C++/Python Flight clients, DoAction now properly streams the results, instead of blocking until the call finishes. Applications that did not consume the iterator before should fully consume the result. ([#15069](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15069))

## C++ notes

## C# notes

No major changes to C#.

## Go notes
* Go's benchmarks will now get added to [Conbench](https://conbench.ursa.dev) alongside the benchmarks for other implementations (GH-32983)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/32983]
* Exposed FlightService_ServiceDesc and RegisterFlightServiceServer to allow easily incorporating a flight service into an existing gRPC server (GH-15174)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15174]

### Arrow
* Function `ApproxEquals` was implemented for scalar values (GH-29581)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/29581]
* `UnmarshalJSON` for the `RecordBuilder` now properly handles extra unknown fields with complex/nested values (GH-31840)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/31840]
* Decimal128 and Decimal256 type support has been added to the CSV reader (GH-33111)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33111]
* Fixed bug in `array.UnionBuilder` where `Len` method always returned 0 (GH-14775)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14775]
* Fixed bug for handling slices of Map arrays when marshalling to JSON and for IPC (GH-14780)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14780]
* Fixed memory leak when compressing IPC message body buffers (GH-14883)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14883]
* Added the ability to easily append scalar values to array builders (GH-15005)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15005]

#### Compute
* Scalar binary (add/subtract/multiply/divide/etc.) and unary arithmetic (abs/neg/sqrt/sign/etc.) has been implemented for the compute package  (GH-33086)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33086] this includes easy functions like `compute.Add` and `compute.Divide` etc.
* Scalar boolean functions like AND/OR/XOR/etc. have been implemented for compute (GH-33279)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33279]
* Scalar comparison function kernels have been implemented for compute (equal/greater/greater_equal/less/less_equal) (GH-33308)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33308]
* Scalar compute functions are compatible with dictionary encoded arrays by casting them to their value types (GH-33502)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33502]

### Parquet
* Panic when decoding a delta_bit_packed encoded column has been fixed (GH-33483)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33483]
* Fixed memory leak from Allocator in `pqarrow.WriteArrowToColumn` (GH-14865)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14865]
* Fixed `writer.WriteBatch` to properly handle writing encrypted parquet columns and no longer silently fail, but instead propagate an error (GH-14940)[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14940]

## Java notes

## JavaScript notes

* Bugfixes and dependency updates.
* Arrow now requires BigInt support. [GH-33681](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/33682)

## Python notes

New features and improvements:

* Numpy conversion for ListArray is improved taking into account sliced offset [(GH-20512)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20512)
* DataFrame Interchange Protocol is implemented for ``pyarrow.Table`` ([GH-33346](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33346)).

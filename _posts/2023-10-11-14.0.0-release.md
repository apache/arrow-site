## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A new RPC method was added to allow polling for completion in long-running queries as an alternative to the blocking GetFlightInfo call ([GH-36155](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36155)). Also, `app_metadata` was added to `FlightInfo` and `FlightEndpoint` ([GH-37635](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37635)).

In C++ and Python, an experimental asynchronous GetFlightInfo call was added to the client-side API ([GH-36512](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36512)). `ServerCallContext` now exposes conveniences to send headers/trailers without having to use middleware ([GH-36952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36952)). The implementation was fixed to not reject unknown field tags to enable interoperability with future versions of Flight that could add new fields ([GH-36975](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36975)). The CMake configuration was fixed to correctly require linking to Arrow Flight RPC when using Arrow Flight SQL ([GH-37406](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37406)). 

In Go, the underlying generated Protobuf code is now exposed for easier low-level integrations with Flight ([GH-36893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36893)). 

In Java, the stateful "login" authentication APIs using the Handshake RPC are deprecated; it will not be removed, but it should not be used unless you specifically want the old behavior ([GH-37722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37722)). Utilities were added to help implement basic Flight SQL services for unit testing ([GH-37795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37795)).

## Community

Since the 13.0.0 release, Metehan Yildirim and Oleks V. have been invited to be committers.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

A `VariableShapeTensorType` was added to the Arrow specification as a canonical extension type. ([GH-24868](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/24868)).

Motivated by recent innovations in DuckDB and Meta's Velox engine, new "view" data types were added to the Arrow columnar format spec. 

* 16-byte StringView and BinaryView data type which enables better buffer reuse, faster "false" string comparisons (due to maintaining a prefix) and short string inlining. ([GH-35627](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35627)).
* ListView and LargeListView types for more performant "out-of-order" building and processing of lists and better buffer reuse ([GH-37876](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37876)).

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A new RPC method was added to allow polling for completion in long-running queries as an alternative to the blocking GetFlightInfo call ([GH-36155](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36155)). Also, `app_metadata` was added to `FlightInfo` and `FlightEndpoint` ([GH-37635](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37635)).

In C++ and Python, an experimental asynchronous GetFlightInfo call was added to the client-side API ([GH-36512](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36512)). `ServerCallContext` now exposes conveniences to send headers/trailers without having to use middleware ([GH-36952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36952)). The implementation was fixed to not reject unknown field tags to enable interoperability with future versions of Flight that could add new fields ([GH-36975](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36975)). The CMake configuration was fixed to correctly require linking to Arrow Flight RPC when using Arrow Flight SQL ([GH-37406](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37406)). 

In Go, the underlying generated Protobuf code is now exposed for easier low-level integrations with Flight ([GH-36893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36893)). 

In Java, the stateful "login" authentication APIs using the Handshake RPC are deprecated; it will not be removed, but it should not be used unless you specifically want the old behavior ([GH-37722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37722)). Utilities were added to help implement basic Flight SQL services for unit testing ([GH-37795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37795)).

## Python notes


## R notes

This release of the R package features a substantial refactor of the package configuration, build, and installation. This change should be transparent to most users; however, package contributors can take advantage of a substantially simplified development setup: in most cases, package contributors should be able to use a pre-built nightly version of Arrow C++ in place of a local Arrow development setup. Special thanks to Jacob Wujciak-Jens for taking on this incredible refactor!

In addition to a number of bugfixes and improvements, this release includes several new features related to CSV input/output:

- Added support for `,` or other characters as a decimal point.
- Added `write_csv_dataset()` to better document CSV-specific dataset writing options.
- Ensured that the `schema` argument can be specified when reading a CSV dataset with partitions.

For more on what’s in the 14.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

- Add support for prepared INSERT queries ([GH-37143](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37143))
- When a prepared statement is automatically closed upon exiting a block, use the same options as when the statement was prepared ([GH-37257](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37257))

### C GLib

- Support more properties of `ArrowFlight::ClientOptions` ([GH-37141](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37141))
- Add support for prepared INSERT queries ([GH-37143](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37143))

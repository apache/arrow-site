The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 14.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**XXX resolved issues**][1]
from [**YYY distinct contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 13.0.0 release, Metehan Yildirim and Oleks V. have been invited to be committers.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

A `VariableShapeTensorType` was added to the Arrow specification as a canonical extension type. ([GH-24868](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/24868)).

Motivated by recent innovations in DuckDB and Meta's Velox engine, new "view" data types were added to the Arrow columnar format spec. 

* 16-byte StringView and BinaryView data type which enables better buffer reuse, faster "false" string comparisons (due to maintaining a prefix) and short string inlining. ([GH-35627](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35627)).
* ListView and LargeListView types for more performant "out-of-order" building and processing of lists and better buffer reuse ([GH-37876](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37876)).

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A new RPC method was added to allow polling for completion in long-running queries as an alternative to the blocking GetFlightInfo call ([GH-36155](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36155)). Also, `app_metadata` was added to `FlightInfo` and `FlightEndpoint` ([GH-37635](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37635)).

In C++ and Python, an experimental asynchronous GetFlightInfo call was added to the client-side API ([GH-36512](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36512)). `ServerCallContext` now exposes conveniences to send headers/trailers without having to use middleware ([GH-36952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36952)). The implementation was fixed to not reject unknown field tags to enable interoperability with future versions of Flight that could add new fields ([GH-36975](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36975)). The CMake configuration was fixed to correctly require linking to Arrow Flight RPC when using Arrow Flight SQL ([GH-37406](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37406)). 

In Go, the underlying generated Protobuf code is now exposed for easier low-level integrations with Flight ([GH-36893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36893)). 

In Java, the stateful "login" authentication APIs using the Handshake RPC are deprecated; it will not be removed, but it should not be used unless you specifically want the old behavior ([GH-37722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37722)). Utilities were added to help implement basic Flight SQL services for unit testing ([GH-37795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37795)).

## C++ notes

## C# notes

## Go notes

## Java notes

Java 21 is enabled and validated in CI ([GH-37914](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37914)).

The Gandiva module implemented a breaking change by moving `Types.proto` into a subfolder ([GH-37893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37893)).

`DefaultVectorComparators` added support for `LargeVarCharVector`, `LargeVarBinaryVector` ([GH-25659](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/25659)) and for `BitVector`, `DateDayVector`, `DateMilliVector`
`Decimal256Vector`, `DecimalVector`, `DurationVector`, `IntervalDayVector`, `TimeMicroVector`, `TimeMilliVector`, `TimeNanoVector`, `TimeSecVector`, `TimeStampVector` ([GH-37701](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37701)).

A bug was fixed in `VectorAppender` to prevent resizing the data buffer twice when appending variable-length vectors ([GH-37829](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37829)).

`VarCharWriter` added support for writing from `Text` and `String` ([GH-37706](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37706)). `VarBinaryWriter` added support for writing from `byte[]` and `ByteBuffer` ([GH-37705](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37705)).

The JDBC driver will now ignore username and password authentication if a token is provided ([GH-37073](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37073)).

A bug was fixed in the Java C-Data interface when importing a vector with an empty array ([GH-37056](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37056)).

A bug was fixed in the S3 file system implementation when closing the connection ([GH-36069](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36069)).

Arrow datasets now support Substrait `ExtendedExpression`s as inputs to filter and project operations ([GH-34252](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34252)).

## JavaScript notes

* GH-21815: [JS] Add support for Duration type #37341
* GH-31621: [JS] Fix Union null bitmaps #37122

## Python notes


## R notes

This release of the R package features a substantial refactor of the package configuration, build, and installation. This change should be transparent to most users; however, package contributors can take advantage of a substantially simplified development setup: in most cases, package contributors should be able to use a pre-built nightly version of Arrow C++ in place of a local Arrow development setup. Special thanks to Jacob Wujciak-Jens for taking on this incredible refactor!

In addition to a number of bugfixes and improvements, this release includes several new features related to CSV input/output:

- Added support for `,` or other characters as a decimal point.
- Added `write_csv_dataset()` to better document CSV-specific dataset writing options.
- Ensured that the `schema` argument can be specified when reading a CSV dataset with partitions.

For more on whatâ€™s in the 14.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes


## Rust notes

The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories outside the
main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Rust
implementation, see the latest [Arrow Rust changelog][5].

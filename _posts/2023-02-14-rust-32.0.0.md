# Introduction

With the recent release of [32.0.0](https://crates.io/crates/arrow/32.0.0) of the Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), it seemed timely to highlight some of the community works since the [last update](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/06/16/rust-16.0.0/).

The most recent list of detailed changes can always be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), with the full historical list available [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG-old.md).

# Arrow

[arrow](https://crates.io/crates/arrow) and [arrow-flight](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight) are native Rust implementations of Apache Arrow. Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.

The [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) offers best in class performance,  memory safety, and the developer productivity of a modern programming language. These features make Rust an excellent choice for building modern high performance analytical systems. When combined, Rust and the Apache Arrow Ecosystem are a compelling toolkit for building the next generation of systems.

The [repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) recently passed 1400 stars on github, and the community has been focused on performance and feature completeness.


**Major Highlights**

* **New CSV and JSON Readers**: The CSV and JSON readers have been revamped. Their performance has more than doubled, and they now support push-driven parsing facilitating async streaming decode from object storage.
* **Faster Build Times and Reduced Codegen**: The `arrow` crate has been split into multiple smaller crates, and large kernels have been moved behind optional feature flags. These changes allow downstream projects to choose a smaller dependency footprint and build times, if desired.
* **Support for Copy-On-Write**: Arrow arrays now support copy-on-write, via the [`into_builder`](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/array/struct.ArrayData.html#method.into_builder) methods
* **Comparable Row Format**: [Much faster multi-column Sorting and Grouping](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-1/) is now possible with the the new spillable, comparable [row-format](https://docs.rs/arrow-row/32.0.0/arrow_row/index.html)
* **FlightSQL Support**: [FlightSQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html) [support](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/32.0.0/arrow_flight/sql/index.html) has been expanded
* **Mid-Level Flight Client**: A new [FlightClient](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/32.0.0/arrow_flight/client/struct.FlightClient.html) is available that handles lower level protocol details, and easier to use [encoding](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/32.0.0/arrow_flight/encode/struct.FlightDataEncoderBuilder.html) and [decoding](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/32.0.0/arrow_flight/decode/struct.FlightDataDecoder.html) APIs.
* **IPC File Compression**: Arrow IPC file [compression](https://docs.rs/arrow-ipc/32.0.0/arrow_ipc/gen/Message/struct.CompressionType.html) with ZSTD and LZ4 is now fully supported.
* **Full Decimal Support**: 256-bit decimals and negative scales can be created and manipulated using many kernels, such as arithmetic.
* **Improved Dictionary Support**: Dictionaries are now transparently supported in most kernels.
* **Improved Temporal Support**: Timestamps with Timezones and other temporal types are supported in many more kernels.
* **Improved Generics**: Improved generics allow writing code generic over all arrays, or all arrays with the same layout
* **Downcast Macros**: Various [helper](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/macro.downcast_primitive_array.html) [macros](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/macro.downcast_dictionary_array.html) are now available to simplify dynamic dispatch to statically typed implementations.

# Parquet

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk. The Apache Parquet implementation in Rust is one of the [fastest and most sophisticated](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/) open source implementations available.


**Major Highlights**

* **Arbitrarily Nested Schema**: Arbitrarily nested schemas can be read to and written from arrow, as described in the series of [blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/10/05/arrow-parquet-encoding-part-1/) on the topic.
* **Predicate Pushdown**: The [arrow reader](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/index.html) now supports advanced predicate pushdown, including late materialization, as described [here](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/). See [RowSelection](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/arrow_reader/struct.RowSelection.html) and [ArrowPredicate](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/arrow_reader/trait.ArrowPredicate.html).
* **Bloom Filter Support**: Support for both [reading and writing bloom filters](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/bloom_filter/index.html) has been added.
* **CLI Tools**: additional [CLI tools](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/master/parquet/src/bin) have been added to introspect and manipulate parquet data.

# Object Store

Modern analytic workloads increasingly make use of blob storage facilities, such as S3, to store large volumes of queryable data. A native Rust object storage implementation that works well with the Rust Ecosystem in general, and the Arrow IO abstractions, is an important building block for many applications.
The [object_store](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/) crate was [donated to the Apache Arrow project in July 2022](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-object-store-donation/) to fill this need, and while it follows a separate release schedule than the `arrow` and `parquet` crates, it forms an integral part of the overarching Arrow IO story.

Recent improvements include the following:

**Major Highlights**

* **Streaming Upload**: Multipart uploads are now supported.
* **Minimised dependency footprint**: Upstream SDKs are no longer used, improving consistency and reducing dependencies.
* **HTTP / WebDAV Support**: Applications can read from arbitrary HTTP servers, with mutation and listing supported on WebDAV-compatible endpoints.
* **Configurable Networking**: Socks proxies, and advanced HTTP client configuration are now supported.
* **Serializable Configuration**: Configuration information can now be easily serialized and deserialized.
* **Additional Authentication**: Additional authentication options are now available for the various cloud providers.

# Contributors:

While some open source software can be created mostly by a single contributor, we believe the greatest software with the largest impact and reach is built around its community. Thus, Arrow is proud to part of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) and our releases both past and present are a result of our amazing community's effort.

We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the arrow-rs repository since the `16.0.0` release. Keep up the great work, and we look forward to continued improvements:

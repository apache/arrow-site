The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 15.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**XXX resolved issues**][1]
from [**YYY distinct contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 14.0.0 release, Curt Hagenlocher, Xuwei Fu, James Duong and Felipe Oliveira Carvalho
have been invited to be committers.
Jonathan Keane and Raúl Cumplido have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).

As per our tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year
Andy Grove was elected as the new PMC chair and VP.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## C Data Interface notes

New format strings have been added for ListView, LargeListView, BinaryView and StringView array types.


## Arrow Flight RPC notes

Flight SQL is now considered stable (GH-39037). The Flight SQL specification was clarified regarding how the result set schema of a prepared statement is affected by bound parameters (GH-37061).

The JDBC Arrow Flight SQL driver now supports mTLS authentication (GH-38460) and bind parameters (GH-33475), follows the Flight RPC spec when fetching data (GH-34532), and can reuse credentials across metadata and data connections (GH-38576). On macOS it will also use the system keychain to be consistent with other platforms (GH-39014). Applications can also retrieve the underlying Flight RPC metadata from the JDBC driver (GH-38024, GH-38022).

### Bug Fixes

### Enhancements

## Java notes

**We expect a breaking change in the next release, Arrow 16.0.0.** Support for Java 9 modules is coming, but that will require changing the JVM flags used to launch your application (GH-38998).  Arrow 15.0.0 is not affected.

A bill-of-materials (BOM) package was added to make it easier to depend on multiple Arrow libraries (GH-38264).

The JDBC adapter (separate from the JDBC driver) now supports 256-bit decimals (GH-39484) and throws more informative exceptions (GH-39355). 

Various improvements were made to utilities for working with vectors (GH-38662, GH-38614, GH-38511, GH-38254, GH-38246). 

## JavaScript notes

This release comes with new features and APIs. We also removed `getByteLength` to reduce bundle sizes.  

New Features with API changes
* [GH-39017: [JS] Add typeId as attribute](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39018)
* [GH-39257: [JS] LargeBinary](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39258)
* [GH-15060: [JS] Add LargeUtf8 type](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/35780)
* [GH-39259: [JS] Remove getByteLength](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39260) 
* [GH-39435: [JS] Add Vector.nullable](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39436)
* [GH-39255: [JS] Allow customization of schema when passing vectors to table constructor](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39256)
* [GH-37983: [JS] Allow nullable fields in table when constructed from vector with nulls](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39254)

Package changes
* [GH-39289: [JS] Add types to exports](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/39475)

## Python notes

Compatibility notes:
* Legacy `ParquetDataset` custom implementation has been removed and only the new dataset  API is now in use [GH-31303](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/31303).

New features:
* PyArrow version 14.0.0 included a new specification for Arrow PyCapsules and related dunder methods [GH-35531](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/37797) and now a public `RecordBatchReader` constructor from stream object implementing the PyCapsule Protocol has been added [GH-[39217](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39217)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39217) together with some additional documentation [GH-[39196](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39196)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39196).

* Python now exposes enabling CRC checksum for read and write operations in Paquet [GH-37242](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37242). CRC checksum are optional and can detect data corruption.
* `CacheOptions` are now configurable from Python as part of the `pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFragmentScanOptions` [GH-36441](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36441).
* Parquet metadata to indicate sort order of the data are now exposed in `RowGroupMetaData` [GH-35331](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35331).

Other improvements:
* Append parameter from `FileOutputStream` is exposed for the `OSFile` class [GH-38857](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38857).
* File size can be passed to `make_fragment` in the pyarrow datasets (`pyarrow.dataset.FileFormat`and `pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat`) [GH-37857](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37857).
* Support for mask parameter is added to `FixedSizeListArray.from_arrays` [GH-34316](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34316)
* `to/from_struct_array` are added to the `pyarrow.Table` class [GH-33500](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33500).
* GIL is released in `.nbytes` which is improving performance when calculating the data size [GH-39096](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39096).
* Usage of pandas internals `DatetimeTZBlock` has been removed [GH-38341](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38341).
* `DataType` instance can be passed to `MapType.from_arrays` constructor [GH-39515](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39515).

Relevant bug fixes:

* No-op kernel is added for `dictionary_encode(dictionary)` [GH-34890](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34890).
* PrettyPrint for Timestamp type now adds "Z" at the end of the print string when tz is defined in order to add minimum information about the values being stored in UTC [GH-30117](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/30117).

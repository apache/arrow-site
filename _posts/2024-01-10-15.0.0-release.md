The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 15.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**XXX resolved issues**][1]
from [**YYY distinct contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 14.0.0 release, Curt Hagenlocher, Xuwei Fu, James Duong and Felipe Oliveira Carvalho
have been invited to be committers.
Jonathan Keane and Raúl Cumplido have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).

As per our tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year
Andy Grove was elected as the new PMC chair and VP.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## C Data Interface notes

New format strings have been added for ListView, LargeListView, BinaryView and StringView array types.


## Arrow Flight RPC notes

Flight SQL is now considered stable (GH-39037). The Flight SQL specification was clarified regarding how the result set schema of a prepared statement is affected by bound parameters (GH-37061).

The JDBC Arrow Flight SQL driver now supports mTLS authentication (GH-38460) and bind parameters (GH-33475), follows the Flight RPC spec when fetching data (GH-34532), and can reuse credentials across metadata and data connections (GH-38576). On macOS it will also use the system keychain to be consistent with other platforms (GH-39014). Applications can also retrieve the underlying Flight RPC metadata from the JDBC driver (GH-38024, GH-38022).

### Bug Fixes

#### Arrow

* Ensured reliability of AuthenticateBasicToken behind proxies ([GH-38198](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38198))
* Ensured release callback is properly called on C Data imported arrays/batches ([GH-38281](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38281))
* Fixed rounding errors in decimal256 string functions ([GH-38395](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38395))
* Added `ValueLen` to Binary and String array interface ([GH-38458](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38458))
* Fixed Decimal128 rounding issues ([GH-38477](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38477))
* Fixed memory leak in IPC LZ4 decompressor ([GH-38728](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38728))
* Addressed Data race in `GetToTimeFunc` for fixed timestamp data types ([GH-38795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38795))
* Fixed "index out of range" error for empty resultsets of FlightSQL driver ([GH-39238](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39238))

#### Parquet

* Fixed issue with max definition levels when writing a Parquet file under certain circumstances ([GH-38503](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38503))
* File writer now properly tracks the number of rows written beyond the last row group ([GH-38516](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38516))

### Enhancements

#### Arrow

* Added an Avro OCF reader for converting Avro files directly to Arrow record batches ([GH-36760](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36760))
* Added support for StringView ([GH-38718](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38718)) and C Data ABI StringViews ([GH-39013](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39013))
* GC Checks were enabled for CI running integration tests ([GH-38824](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38824))

#### Parquet

* Implemented Float16 logical type for Parquet files ([GH-37582](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37582))
* Added proper boolean RLE encoding/decoding ([GH-38462](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38462))

### Bug Fixes

### Enhancements

## Java notes

**We expect a breaking change in the next release, Arrow 16.0.0.** Support for Java 9 modules is coming, but that will require changing the JVM flags used to launch your application (GH-38998).  Arrow 15.0.0 is not affected.

A bill-of-materials (BOM) package was added to make it easier to depend on multiple Arrow libraries (GH-38264).

The JDBC adapter (separate from the JDBC driver) now supports 256-bit decimals (GH-39484) and throws more informative exceptions (GH-39355). 

Various improvements were made to utilities for working with vectors (GH-38662, GH-38614, GH-38511, GH-38254, GH-38246).

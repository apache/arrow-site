The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.13.0 release. This covers
more than 2 months of development work and includes [**550 resolved
issues**][1] from [**81 distinct contributors**][22].

See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your
platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.

While it's a large release, this post will give some brief highlights in the
project since the 0.12.0 release from January.

## New committers and PMC member

The Arrow team is growing! Since the 0.12.0 release we have increased the size
of our committer and PMC rosters.

* [Andy Grove][13] was promoted to PMC member
* [Paddy Horan][245] was added as a committer
* [Micah Kornfield][14] was added as a committer
* [Ravindra Pindikura][246] was added as a committer
* [Chao Sun][247] was added as a committer

Thank you for all your contributions!

## Rust DataFusion Query Engine donation

Since the last release, we received a donation of [DataFusion][17], a
Rust-native query engine for the Arrow columnar format, whose development had
been led prior by Andy Grove. [Read more about DataFusion][19] in our February
blog post.

This is an exciting development for the Rust community, and we look forward to
developing more analytical query processing within the Apache Arrow project.

## Arrow Flight gRPC progress

Over the last couple months, we have made significant progress on Arrow Flight,
an Arrow-native data messaging framework. We have integration tests to check
C++ and Java compatibility, and we have added Python bindings for the C++
library. We will write a future blog post to go into more detail about how
Flight works.

## C++ notes

There were 231 issues relating to C++ in this release, far too much to
summarize in a blog post. Some notable items include:

* An experimental `ExtensionType` was developed for creating user-defined data
  types that can be embedded in the Arrow binary protocol. This is not yet
  finalized, but [feedback would be welcome][51].
* We have undertaken a significant reworking of our CMake build system for C++
  to make the third party dependencies more configurable. Among other things,
  this eases work on packaging for Linux distributions. Read more about this in
  the [C++ developer documentation][18].
* Laying more groundwork for an Arrow-native in-memory query engine
* We began building a reader for line-delimited JSON files
* Gandiva can now be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio

## C# Notes

C# .NET development has picked up since the initial code donation last
fall. 11 issues were resolved this release cycle.

The Arrow C# package is [now available via NuGet][244].

## Go notes

8 Go-related issues were resolved. A notable feature is the addition of a CSV
file writer.

## Java notes

26 Java issues were resolved. Outside of Flight-related work, some notable
items include:

* Migration to Java 8 date and time APIs from Joda
* Array type support in JDBC adapter

## Javascript Notes

The recent [JavaScript 0.4.1 release][243] is the last JavaScript-only release
of Apache Arrow. Starting with 0.13 the Javascript implementation is now
included in mainline Arrow releases! The version number of the released
JavaScript packages will now be in sync with the mainline version number.

## Python notes

86 Python-related issues were resolved. Some highlights include:

* The Gandiva LLVM expression compiler is now available in the Python wheels
  through the ``pyarrow.gandiva`` module.
* Flight RPC bindings
* Improved pandas serialization performance with RangeIndex
* pyarrow can be used without pandas installed

Note that Apache Arrow will continue to support Python 2.7 until January 2020.

## Ruby and C GLib notes

36 C/GLib- and Ruby-related issues were resolved. The work continues to follow
the upstream work in the C++ project.

* `Arrow::RecordBatch#raw_records` was added. It can convert a record batch to
  a Ruby's array in 10x-200x faster than the same conversion by a pure-Ruby
  implementation.

## Rust notes

69 Rust-related issues were resolved. Many of these relate to ongoing work in
the DataFusion query engine. Some notable items include:

* Date/time support
* SIMD for arithmetic operations
* Writing CSV and reading line-delimited JSON
* Parquet data source support for DataFusion
* Prototype DataFrame-style API for DataFusion
* Continued evolution of Parquet file reader

## R development progress

The Arrow R developers have expanded the scope of the R language bindings and
additionally worked on packaging support to be able to submit the package to
CRAN in the near future. 23 issues were resolved for this release.

[We wrote in January about ongoing work][50] to accelerate R work on Apache Spark
using Arrow.

## Community Discussions Ongoing

There are a number of active discussions ongoing on the developer
``dev@arrow.apache.org`` mailing list. We look forward to hearing from the
community there:

* **Benchmarking**: we are working to create tools for tracking all of our
  benchmark results on a commit-by-commit basis in a centralized database
  schema so that we can monitor for performance regressions over time. We hope
  to develop a publicly viewable benchmark result dashboard.
* **C++ Datasets**: development of a unified API for reading and writing
  datasets stored in various common formats like Parquet, JSON, and CSV.
* **C++ Query Engine**: architecture of a parallel Arrow-native query engine
  for C++
* **Arrow Flight Evolution**: adding features to support different real-world
  data messaging use cases
* **Arrow Columnar Format evolution**: we are discussing a new "duration" or
  "time interval" type and some other additions to the Arrow columnar format.

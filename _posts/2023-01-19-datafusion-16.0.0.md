# Introduction

[DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) is an extensible
query execution framework, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
that uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) as its
in-memory format. It is targeted primarily at developers creating data
intensive analytics, and offers mature
[SQL support](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/index.html),
a DataFrame API, and many extension points.

Systems based on DataFusion perform very well in benchmarks,
especially considering they operate directly on parquet files rather
than first loading into a specialized format.  Some recent highlights
include [clickbench](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) and the
[Cloudfuse.io standalone query
engines](https://www.cloudfuse.io/dashboards/standalone-engines) page.

DataFusion is also part of a longer term trend, articulated clearly by
[Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) in his [2022 Databases
Retrospective](https://ottertune.com/blog/2022-databases-retrospective/).
Database frameworks are proliferating and it is likely that all OLAP
DBMSs and other data heavy applications, such as machine learning,
will **require** a vectorized, highly performant query engine in the next
5 years to remain relevant.  The only practical way to make such
technology so widely available without many millions of dollars of
investment is though open source engine such as DataFusion or
[Velox](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox).

The rest of this post describes the improvements made to DataFusion
over the last three months and some hints of where we are heading.


## Community Growth

We again saw significant growth in the DataFusion community since [our last update](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/10/25/datafusion-13.0.0/). There are some interesting metrics on [OSSRank](https://ossrank.com/p/1573-apache-arrow-datafusion).

The DataFusion 16.0.0 release consists of 543 PRs from 73 distinct contributors, not including all the work that goes into dependencies such as [arrow](https://crates.io/crates/arrow), [parquet](https://crates.io/crates/parquet), and [object_store](https://crates.io/crates/object_store), that much of the same community helps support. Thank you all for your help

Several [new systems based on DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion#known-uses) were recently added:

* [Greptime DB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb)
* [Synnada](https://synnada.ai/)
* [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql-query)
- [Parseable](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable)
* [SeaFowl](https://github.com/splitgraph/seafowl)


## Performance ðŸš€

Performance and efficiency are core values for
DataFusion. While there is still a gap between DataFusion and the best of
breed, tightly integrated systems such as [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org)
and [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/), DataFusion is
closing the gap quickly. Performance highlights from the last three
months:

* Up to 30% Faster Sorting and Merging using the new [Row Format](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-1/)
* [Advanced predicate pushdown](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/), directly on parquet, directly from object storage, enabling sub millisecond filtering. <!-- Andrew nots: we should really get this turned on by default -->
* `70%` faster `IN` expressions evaluation ([#4057])
* Sort and partition aware optimizations ([#3969] and  [#4691])
* Filter selectivity analysis ([#3868])

## Runtime Resource Limits

Previously, DataFusion could potentially use unbounded amounts of memory for certain queries that included Sorts, Grouping or Joins.

In version 16.0.0, it is possible to limit DataFusion's memory usage for Sorting and Grouping. We are looking for help adding similar limiting for Joins as well as expanding our algorithms to optionally spill to secondary storage. See [#3941] for more detail.


## SQL Window Functions

[SQL Window Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_(SQL)) are useful for a variety of analysis and DataFusion's implementation support expanded significantly:

- Custom window frames such as `... OVER (ORDER BY ... RANGE BETWEEN 0.2 PRECEDING AND 0.2 FOLLOWING)`
- Unbounded window frames such as `... OVER (ORDER BY ... RANGE UNBOUNDED ROWS PRECEDING)`
- Support for the `NTILE` window function ([#4676])
- Support for `GROUPS` mode ([#4155])


# Improved Joins

Joins are often the most complicated operations to handle well in
analytics systems and DataFusion 16.0.0 offers significant improvements
such as

- Cost based optimizer (CBO) automatically reorders join evaluations, selects algorithms (Merge / Hash), and pick build side based on available statistics and join type (`INNER`, `LEFT`, etc) ([#4219])
- Fast non `column=column` equijoins such as `JOIN ON a.x + 5 = b.y`
- Better performance on non-equijoins ([#4562]) <!-- TODO is this a good thing to mention as any time this is usd the query is going to go slow or the data size is small -->

# Streaming Execution

One emerging use case for Datafusion is as a foundation for
streaming-first data platforms. An important prerequisite
is support for incremental execution for queries that can be computed
incrementally.

With this release, DataFusion now supports the following streaming features:

* Data ingestion from infinite files such as FIFOs ([#4694]),
* Detection of pipeline-breaking queries in streaming use cases ([#4694]),
* Automatic input swapping for joins so probe side is a data stream ([#4694]),
* Intelligent elision of pipeline-breaking sort operations whenever possible ([#4691]),
* Incremental execution for more types of queries; e.g. queries involving finite window frames ([#4777]).

These are a major steps forward, and we plan even more improvements over the next few releases.

# Better Support for Distributed Catalogs

16.0.0 has been enhanced support for asynchronous catalogs ([#4607])
to better support distributed metadata stores such as
[Delta.io](https://delta.io/) and [Apache
Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) which require asynchronous I/O
during planning to access remote catalogs. Previously, DataFusion
required synchronous access to all relevant catalog information.


# Additional SQL Support
SQL support continues to improve, including some of these highlights:

- Add TPC-DS query planning regression tests [#4719]
- Support for `PREPARE` statement [#4490]
- Automatic coercions ast between Date and Timestamp [#4726]
- Support type coercion for timestamp and utf8 [#4312]
- Full support for time32 and time64 literal values (`ScalarValue`) [#4156]
- New functions, incuding `uuid()`  [#4041], `current_time`  [#4054], `current_date` [#4022]
- Compressed CSV/JSON support [#3642]

The community has also invested in new [sqllogic based](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/master/datafusion/core/tests/sqllogictests/README.md) tests to keep improving DataFusion's quality with less effort.

# Plan Serialization and Substrait

DataFusion now supports serialization of physical plans, with a custom protocol buffers format. In addition, we are adding initial support for [Substrait](https://substrait.io/), a Cross-Language Serialization for Relational Algebra

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 13.0.0 release, Metehan Yildirim and Oleks V. have been invited to be committers.

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

Motivated by recent innovations in DuckDB and Meta's Velox engine, new "view" data types were added to the Arrow columnar format spec:

* 16-byte StringView and BinaryView data types which enable better buffer reuse, faster "false" string comparisons (due to maintaining a prefix) and short string inlining ([GH-35627](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35627)).
* ListView and LargeListView types for more performant "out-of-order" building and processing of lists and better buffer reuse ([GH-37876](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37876)).

A `VariableShapeTensorType` was added to the Arrow specification as a canonical extension type ([GH-24868](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/24868)).

## C Data Interface notes

Integration testing has been added for the C Data Interface accross Arrow implementations,
ensuring mutual compatibility. ([GH-37537](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37537)).
The C++, C# and Go implementations are covered, with Arrow Java soon to come.

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A new RPC method was added to allow polling for completion in long-running queries as an alternative to the blocking GetFlightInfo call ([GH-36155](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36155)). Also, `app_metadata` was added to `FlightInfo` and `FlightEndpoint` ([GH-37635](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37635)).

In C++ and Python, an experimental asynchronous GetFlightInfo call was added to the client-side API ([GH-36512](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36512)). `ServerCallContext` now exposes conveniences to send headers/trailers without having to use middleware ([GH-36952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36952)). The implementation was fixed to not reject unknown field tags to enable interoperability with future versions of Flight that could add new fields ([GH-36975](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36975)). The CMake configuration was fixed to correctly require linking to Arrow Flight RPC when using Arrow Flight SQL ([GH-37406](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37406)). 

In Go, the underlying generated Protobuf code is now exposed for easier low-level integrations with Flight ([GH-36893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36893)). 

In Java, the stateful "login" authentication APIs using the Handshake RPC are deprecated; it will not be removed, but it should not be used unless you specifically want the old behavior ([GH-37722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37722)). Utilities were added to help implement basic Flight SQL services for unit testing ([GH-37795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37795)).

## C++ notes

Experimental APIs for exporting and importing non-CPU arrays using the C Device Data Interface
have been added ([GH-36488](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36488)), together with an experimental API for device synchronization
([GH-36103](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36103)).

Initial compatibility with Emscripten without threading support has been added ([GH-35176](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35176)).

### Compute layer

New compute functions:
* a `cumulative_mean` function on numeric data ([GH-36931](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36931));

Improved compute functions:
* rounding functions now work natively on integer inputs instead of casting them to floats ([GH-35273](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35273));
* the `divide` function now supports duration inputs ([GH-36789](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36789));
* `take` and `filter` now support sparse unions in addition to dense unions ([GH-36905](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36905));
* `if_else`, `coalesce`, `choose` and `case_when` now support duration inputs ([GH-37028](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37028));
* casting between fixed-size lists and variable-size lists is now supported ([GH-20086](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20086));
* casting from strings to dates is now supported ([GH-37411](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37411));
* `mean` on integer inputs now uses a floating-point representation for its intermediate sum,
  avoiding integer overflow on large inputs ([GH-34909](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34909));

### Datasets

Support for writing encrypted Parquet datasets has been added ([GH-29238](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/29238)).

### Gandiva

Gandiva now supports linking dynamically to LLVM on non-Windows platforms ([GH-37410](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37410)).
Previously, Gandiva would always link LLVM statically into `libgandiva`.

### Parquet

RLE is used by default when encoding boolean values if v2 data pages are enabled
([GH-36882](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36882)).

Page indexes can now be encrypted as per the specification ([GH-34950](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34950)).

A bug in the DELTA_BINARY_PACKED encoder leading to suboptimal column sizes was fixed ([GH-37939](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37939)).

### Substrait

It is now possible to serialize and deserialize individual expressions using Substrait,
not only full query plans ([GH-33985](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33985)).

### Miscellaneous

A new `CodecOptions` class allows customizing compression parameters per-codec ([GH-35287](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35287)).

The environment variable `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` is now respected when resolving S3 URIs ([GH-36770](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36770)).

Recursively listing S3 filesystem trees should now issue less requests,
leading to improved performance ([GH-34213](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34213)).

Comparing a `ChunkedArray` to itself now behaves correctly with NaN values ([GH-37515](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37515)).

The use of BMI2 instructions on x86 was incorrectly guarded. Those instructions
could be executed on platforms without BMI2 support, leading to crashes ([GH-37017](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37017)).


## C# notes

The following features have been added to the C# implementation apart from other minor ones and some fixes.

* Support fixed-size lists ([GH-33032](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33032))
* Support DateOnly and TimeOnly on .NET 6.0+ ([GH-34620](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34620))

* Flight SQL implementation for C# ([GH-36078](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36078))
* Implement support for dense and sparse unions ([GH-36795](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36795))

## Go Notes

* The minimum version of Go officially supported is now `go1.19` instead of `go1.17` ([GH-37636](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37636))

## Java notes

Java 21 is enabled and validated in CI ([GH-37914](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37914)).

The Gandiva module implemented a breaking change by moving `Types.proto` into a subfolder ([GH-37893](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37893)).

`DefaultVectorComparators` added support for `LargeVarCharVector`, `LargeVarBinaryVector` ([GH-25659](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/25659)) and for `BitVector`, `DateDayVector`, `DateMilliVector`
`Decimal256Vector`, `DecimalVector`, `DurationVector`, `IntervalDayVector`, `TimeMicroVector`, `TimeMilliVector`, `TimeNanoVector`, `TimeSecVector`, `TimeStampVector` ([GH-37701](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37701)).

A bug was fixed in `VectorAppender` to prevent resizing the data buffer twice when appending variable-length vectors ([GH-37829](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37829)).

`VarCharWriter` added support for writing from `Text` and `String` ([GH-37706](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37706)). `VarBinaryWriter` added support for writing from `byte[]` and `ByteBuffer` ([GH-37705](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37705)).

The JDBC driver will now ignore username and password authentication if a token is provided ([GH-37073](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37073)).

A bug was fixed in the Java C-Data interface when importing a vector with an empty array ([GH-37056](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37056)).

A bug was fixed in the S3 file system implementation when closing the connection ([GH-36069](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36069)).

Arrow datasets now support Substrait `ExtendedExpression`s as inputs to filter and project operations ([GH-34252](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34252)).

## JavaScript notes

* GH-21815: [JS] Add support for Duration type #37341
* GH-31621: [JS] Fix Union null bitmaps #37122

## Python notes

Compatibility notes:
* Support for Python 3.12 was added ([GH-37880](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37880))
* Support for Cython 3 was added ([GH-37742](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37742))
* PyArrow is now compatible with numpy 2.0 ([GH-37574](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37574))
* `pyarrow.compute.CumulativeSumOptions` has been deprecated, use `pyarrow.compute.CumulativeOptions` instead ([GH-36240](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36240))

New features:
* Allowing type promotion is now possible in `pyarrow.concat_tables` ([GH-36845](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36845))
* Support for vector function UDF was added ([GH-36672](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36672))

Other improvements:
* The default of `pre_buffer` is now set to `True` for reading Parquet when using `pyarrow.dataset` directly. This can give significant speed-up on filesystems like S3 and is now aligned to `pyarrow.parquet.read_table` interface ([GH-36765](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36765))
* Path to timezone database can now be set through python API ([GH-35600](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35600), [GH-38145] (https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38145))
* `pyarrow.MapScalar.as_py`can now be called with custom field name ([GH-36809](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36809))
* `FixedShapeTensorType` string representation now prints the type parameters ([GH-35623](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35623))

Relevant bug fixes:
* String to date cast kernel was added to fix python scalar cast regression ([GH-37411](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37411))
* Fix conversion from Python to Arrow when chunking large nested structs ([GH-32439](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/32439))
* Fix segfault when passing table as argument to `pyarrow.Table.filter` ([GH-37650](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37650))
* `use_threads` keyword was added to the `group_by` method on `pyarrow.Table` which gets passed through to the `pyarrow.acero.Declaration.to_table` call. Specifing `use_threads=False`allows to get stable ordering of the output ([GH-36709](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36709))
* Fix printable representation for `pyarrow.TimestampScalar` when values are outside datetime range ([GH-36323](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36323))
* Empty dataframes with zero chunks can now be consumed by the Dataframe Interchange Protocol implementation ([GH-37050](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37050)) 
* Fix dtype information for categorical columns in the Dataframe Interchange Protocol implementation ([GH-38034](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38034))
* Boolean columns with bitsize 1 are now supported in `from_dataframe`of the Dataframe Interchange Protocol ([GH-37145](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37145))

Further, the Python bindings benefit from improvements in the C++ library
(e.g. new compute functions); see the C++ notes above for additional details.

The Arrow documentation is now built with an updated Pydata Sphinx Theme which includes light/dark theme, new colors from [Accessible pygments themes](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments), version switcher dropdown, search button, etc. ([GH-36590](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36590), [GH-32451](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/32451))

## R notes

This release of the R package features a substantial refactor of the package configuration, build, and installation. This change should be transparent to most users; however, package contributors can take advantage of a substantially simplified development setup: in most cases, package contributors should be able to use a pre-built nightly version of Arrow C++ in place of a local Arrow development setup. Special thanks to Jacob Wujciak-Jens for taking on this incredible refactor!

In addition to a number of bugfixes and improvements, this release includes several new features related to CSV input/output:

- Added support for `,` or other characters as a decimal point.
- Added `write_csv_dataset()` to better document CSV-specific dataset writing options.
- Ensured that the `schema` argument can be specified when reading a CSV dataset with partitions.

For more on what’s in the 14.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

- Add support for prepared INSERT queries ([GH-37143](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37143))
- When a prepared statement is automatically closed upon exiting a block, use the same options as when the statement was prepared ([GH-37257](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37257))

### C GLib

- Support more properties of `ArrowFlight::ClientOptions` ([GH-37141](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37141))
- Add support for prepared INSERT queries ([GH-37143](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37143))

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.3.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 42 resolved issues from
4 contributors.

## Release Highlights

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.3.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

### C library

The nanoarrow 0.3.0 release includes a number of bugfixes and improvements
to the core C library and IPC C extension:

- Improved bit packing/unpacking utilities and performance in tandem with an
  [experiment to use bitmasks in pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/54506)
- Added support for building and consuming interval arrays
- Fixed full validation of offset buffers for specific types of corrupted data
  that caused overflow
- Fixed crashes that occurred for certain types of corrupted data and improved
  error messages that were misleading for other types of corrupted data.

### R bindings

The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the `nanoarrow` package on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). The 0.3.0 release of the R bindings includes
improvements in type support and stability. Notably:

- Conversion to/from `bit64::integer64()` is now supported
- Warnings and errors for conversions that are invalid or
  may loose accuracy were improved
- Extension types and extension type registration are now supported
- Conversion of dictionary-encoded arrays to R vectors is now supported
- Conversion of map arrays to R vectors is now supported
- Improved performance of stream conversion to R vectors for streams of
  indeterminate length (e.g., database results from ADBC).

### Experimental non-CPU support

With the addition of the
[Arrow C Device data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html)
comes an opportunity for nanoarrow to handle non-CPU (e.g., GPU) data. The
[nanoarrow_device](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/extensions/nanoarrow_device)
extension was drafted in tandem with the specification and Arrow C++ implementation.
While it is not an official part of the 0.3.0 release, it is available in an
experimental state for those interested in its use and/or development.

### Contributor experience

The 0.3.0 release features adoption of `pre-commit` hooks to improve consistency
and contributor experience with a complex repository. Special thanks to
[@WillAyd](https://github.com/WillAyd) for setting this up!

## Contributors

This release consists of contributions from 4 contributors in addition
to the invaluable advice and support of the Apache Arrow developer mailing list.

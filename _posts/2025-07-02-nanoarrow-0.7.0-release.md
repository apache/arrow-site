The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.7.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 117 resolved issues from
12 contributors.

## Release Highlights

- Migrate Python bindings to Meson Python
- Better support for shared linkage
- ZSTD Decompression support in IPC reader
- Decimal32, Decimal64, ListView and LargeListView support
- Support for vcpkg

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.7.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

## Features

### Meson Python

The Python bindings now use [Meson Python](https://mesonbuild.com/meson-python/) as
the build backend. The main benefit is that adding C or C++ library dependencies
like ZSTD is much simpler than with setuptools which was needed to add the new
decompression support to the Python bindings.

Thanks to [@WillAyd](https://github.com/WillAyd) for this contribution and continued
maintenance of the Python build infrastructure!

### Shared Linkage

The nanoarrow C library is generally designed to be statically linked into an
application or library; however, there were some applications that did want
shared linkage and on Windows some extra work was needed to ensure this worked
as intended. Version 0.7.0 includes the appropriate DLL import/export attributes
and adds dedicated `nanoarrow_shared` and `nanoarrow_static` targets to the CMake
configuration to explicitly choose a strategy (linking to `nanoarrow` will continue
to use the CMake default as it did in previous versions).

Thanks to [@m-kuhn](https://github.com/m-kuhn) for authoring the initial vcpkg
configuration that brought this to our attention!

### ZSTD Decompression Support

The Arrow IPC reader included in the nanoarrow C library supports most features
of the Arrow IPC format; however, decompression support was missing which made
the library and its bindings unusable for some common use cases. In 0.7.0,
decompression support was added to the C library and R and Python bindings.

```

Users of the C library will need to configure CMake with `-DNANOARROW_IPC_WITH_ZSTD=ON`
and `-DNANOARROW_IPC=ON` to use CMake-resolved ZSTD; however, client libraries
can also use an existing ZSTD or LZ4 implementation using callbacks.

### New Type Support

While the nanoarrow C library is a minimal library, we do strive to support the full
specification and several new types were not supported by the C library. Version 0.7.0
includes support in the C library for Decimal32, Decimal64, ListView, and LargeListView
and improved support for support for decimal types in the nanoarrow R bindings.

Thanks to [@zeroshade](https://github.com/zeroshade) for contributing Decimal32/Decimal64
support and [@WillAyd](https://github.com/WillAyd) for contributing

### nanoarrow on vcpkg

The nanoarrow C library can now be installed using
[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)!

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg && ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg install nanoarrow
```

CMake projects can then use `find_package(nanoarrow)` when using the vcpkg
toolchain (i.e., `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`).
This also allows other vcpkg ports to use nanoarrow as a dependency in addition
to a convenience for projects already using vcpkg.

Thanks to [@m-kuhn](https://github.com/m-kuhn) for contributing the nanoarrow port to
vcpkg!

### Highlights

- Half-float values can now be parsed and formatted correctly (GH-41089).
- Record batches can now be converted to row-major tensors, not only column-major (GH-40866).
- The CSV writer is now able to write large string arrays that are larger than
  2 GiB (GH-40270).
- A possible invalid memory access in `BooleanArray.true_count()` has been fixed (GH-41016).
- A new method `FlattenRecursively` allows recursive nesting of list and
  fixed-size list arrays (GH-41055).
- The scratch space in some `Scalar` subclasses is now immutable. This is required
  for proper concurrent access to `Scalar` instances (GH-40069).
- Calling the `bit_width` or `byte_width` method of an extension type now defers
  to the underlying storage type (GH-41353).
- Fixed a bug where `MapArray::FromArrays` would behave incorrectly if the given
  offsets array has a non-zero offset (GH-40750).
- `MapArray::FromArrays` now accepts an optional null bitmap argument
  (GH-41684).
- The `ARROW_NO_DEPRECATED_API` macro was unused and has been removed (GH-41343).

### Acero

- The left anti join filter no longer crashes when the filter rows are empty (GH-41121).
- A race condition was fixed in the asof join (GH-41149).
- A potential stack overflow has been fixed (GH-41334, GH-41738).
- A potential crash on very large data has been fixed (GH-41813).
- Asof join and sort merge join now support single threaded mode (GH-41190).

### Compute

- List views and maps are now supported by the `if_else`, `case_when` and
  `coalesce` functions (GH-41418).
- List views are now supported by the functions `list_slice` (GH-42065),
  `list_parent_indices` (GH-42235), `take` and `filter` (GH-42116).
- `list_flatten` can now be recursive based on new optional argument
  (GH-41183, GH-41055)
- The `take` and `filter` functions have been made significantly faster on fixed-width
  types, including fixed-size lists of fixed-width types (GH-39798).

### Dataset

- Repeated scanning of an encrypted Parquet dataset now works correctly (GH-41431).

### Filesystems

- Standard filesystem implementations are now tracked in a global registry which
  also allows loading third-party filesystem implementations, for example from
  runtime-loaded DLLs (GH-40342,
- Directory metadata operations on Azure filesystems are now more aligned with
  the common expectations for filesystems (GH-41034).
- `CopyFile` is now supported for Azure filesystems with hierarchical namespace
  enabled (GH-41095).
- Azure credentials can now be loaded explicitly from the environment (GH-39345),
  or using the Azure CLI (GH-39344).
- A potential deadlock was fixed when closing an S3 output stream (GH-41862).

### GPU

- Non-CPU data can now be pretty-printed (GH-41664).
- Non-CPU data with offsets, such as list and binary data, can now be properly
  sent over IPC (GH-42198).

### IPC

- Flatbuffers serialization is now more deterministic (GH-40361).

### Parquet

- A crash was fixed when reading an invalid Parquet file where columns claim to
  be of different lengths (GH-41317).
- Definition and repetition levels are now more strictly checked, avoiding later
  crashes when reading an invalid Parquet file (GH-41321).
- A crash was fixed when reading an invalid encrypted Parquet file (GH-43070).
- Fixed a bug where `DeltaLengthByteArrayEncoder::EstimatedDataEncodedSize` could
  return an invalid estimate in some situations (GH-41545).
- Delimiting records is now faster for columns with nested repeating (GH-41361).

### Substrait

- Support for more Arrow data types was added: some temporal types, half floats,
  large string and large binary (GH-40695).

## C# notes

- The performance of building Decimal arrays using SqlDecimal values was improved for .NET 7+ (GH-41349)
- Scalar arrays now implement `ICollection<T?>` (GH-38692)
- Concatenating arrays with a non-zero offset with ArrowArrayConcatenator was fixed (GH-41164)
- Concatenating union arrays with ArrowArrayConcatenator was fixed (GH-41198)
- Accessing values of decimal arrays with a non-zero offset was fixed (GH-41199)

## Go Notes

### Bug Fixes

#### Arrow

- Prevent exposure of invalid Go pointers in CGO code ([GH-43062](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43062))
- Fix memory leak for 0-length C array imports ([GH=41534](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41534))
- Ensure statement handle is updated so stateless prepared statements work properly ([GH-41427](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41427))

#### Parquet

- Fix memory leak in BufferedPageWriter ([GH-41697](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41697))
- Fix performance regression in PooledBufferWriter ([GH-41541](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41541))

### Enhancements

#### Arrow

- Arrow Schemas and Records can now be created from Protobuf messages ([GH-40494](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40494))

#### Parquet

- Performance improvement for BitWriter VlqInt ([GH-41160](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/41160))

## Java notes

**Some changes are coming up in the next version, Arrow 18. Java 8 support will be removed. The version of the flight-core artifact with shaded gRPC will no longer be distributed.**

- Basic support for ListView (GH-41287) and StringView (GH-40339) has been added. These types should still be considered experimental. 

## JavaScript notes

- General maintenance. Clean up packaging ([GH-39722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39722)), update dependencies ([GH-41905](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41905)).

## Python notes

### Compatibility notes:
* To ensure Python 3.13 compatibility, _Py_IsFinalizing has been replaced with a public API (GH-41475).
* The C Data Interface now supports CUDA devices (GH-40384).

### New features:
* Added support for Emscripten via Pyodide (GH-41910).

### Other improvements:
* The ParquetWriter added the store_decimal_as_integer option (GH-42168).
* The Float16 logical type is supported in Parquet (GH-42016).
* Exposed bit_width and byte_width to extension types (GH-41389).
* Added bindings for Device and MemoryManager classes (GH-41126).
* The PyCapsule interface now exposes the device interface (GH-38325).
* Various PyArrow APIs have been updated to work with non-CPU architectures gracefully. (GH-42112, GH-41664, GH-41662, 

### Relevant bug fixes:
* Fixed Numpy 2.0 compatibility issues (GH-42170, GH-41924).
* Fixed sporadic as_of join failures (GH-41149).
* Fixed a bug in RecordBatch.filter() when passing a ChunkedArray, which would cause a segfault (GH-38770).
* Fixed a bug in RecordBatch.from_arrays() when passing a storage array, which would cause a segfault (GH-37669).
* Fixed a bug where constructing a MapArray from Array could drop nulls (GH-41684).
* FIxed a bug where RunEndEncodedArray.from_arrays fails if run_ends are pyarrow.Array (GH-40560).
* FIxed a regression introduced in PyArrow v16 in RecordBatchReader.cast() (GH-41884).

## R notes

* R functions that users write that use functions that Arrow supports in dataset queries now can be used in queries too. Previously, only functions that used arithmetic operators worked. For example, `time_hours <- function(mins) mins / 60` worked, but `time_hours_rounded <- function(mins) round(mins / 60)` did not; now both work. These are automatic translations rather than true user-defined functions (UDFs); for UDFs, see `register_scalar_function()`. [GH-41223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41223)
* `mutate()` expressions can now include aggregations, such as `x - mean(x)`. [GH-41350](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/41350)
* `summarize()` supports more complex expressions, and correctly handles cases where column names are reused in expressions. [GH-41323](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41323)
* The `na_matches` argument to the `dplyr::*_join()` functions is now supported. This argument controls whether `NA` values are considered equal when joining. [GH-41223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41358)
* R metadata, stored in the Arrow schema to support round-tripping data between R and Arrow/Parquet, is now serialized and deserialized more strictly. This makes it safer to load data from files from unknown sources into R data.frames. [GH-41223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41969)

For more on what’s in the 17.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

- Improved `Arrow::Table#to_s` format
  - This is a breaking change

- Added support for Microsoft Visual C++
- Added `gadataset_dataset_to_record_batch_reader()`

## Rust notes

The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories outside the
main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Rust
implementation, see the latest [Arrow Rust changelog][5].

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 12.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**476 resolved issues**][1]
with [**531 commits from 97 distinct contributors**][2].
See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 11.0.0 release, Wang Mingming, Mustafa Akur and Ruihang Xia
have been invited to be committers.
Will Jones have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes

A first "canonical" extension type has been formalized: `arrow.fixed_shape_tensor` to
represent an Array where each slot contains a tensor, with all tensors having the same
dimension and shape, [GH-33923](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33923).
This is based on a Fixed-Size List layout as storage array
(<https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#fixed-shape-tensor-extension>).

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

The JDBC driver for Arrow Flight SQL has had some bugfixes, and has been refactored into a core library (which is not distributed as an uberjar with shaded names) and a driver (which is distributed as an uberjar).

The Java server builder API now offers easier access to the underlying gRPC builder.

Go now implements the Flight SQL extensions for Substrait and transaction support.

* Custom type mapper in `to_pandas` now converts index dtypes together with column dtypes ([GH-34283](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34283))

## R notes

* The `read_parquet()` and `read_feather()` functions can now accept URL
  arguments.

  a file path containing the appropriate authentication token.
* The `$options` member of `GcsFileSystem` objects can now be inspected.
* The `read_csv_arrow()` and `read_json_arrow()` functions now accept literal text input wrapped in
  `I()` to improve compatability with `readr::read_csv()`.
* Nested fields can now be accessed using `$` and `[[` in dplyr expressions.

For more on what’s in the 12.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

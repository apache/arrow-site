## R notes

The R package added support for converting to and from many additional Arrow types. Tables showing how R types are mapped to Arrow types and vice versa have been added to the [introductory vignette][6], and nearly all types are handled. In addition, R `attributes` like custom classes and metadata are now preserved when converting a `data.frame` to an Arrow Table and are restored when loading them back into R.

For more on whatâ€™s in the 1.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

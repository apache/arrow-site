The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.2.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This initial release covers 19 resolved issues from
6 contributors.

## Release Highlights

- Addition of the Arrow [IPC stream reader extension](#ipc-stream-support)
- Addition of the [Getting Started with nanoarrow](#getting-started-with-nanoarrow)
  tutorial
- Improvements in reliability and platform test coverage of the [C library](#c-library)
- Improvements in reliability and type support in the [R bindings](#r-bindings)

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

## IPC stream support

This release includes support for reading schemas and record batches serialized
using the
[Arrow IPC format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc). Based on the
[flatcc](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)
flatbuffers implementation, the nanoarrow IPC read support is implemented as
an optional extension to the core nanoarrow library. The easiest way to get
started is with the `ArrowArrayStream` provider using one of the built-in
`ArrowIpcInputStream` implementations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#include "nanoarrow_ipc.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  FILE* file_ptr = freopen(NULL, "rb", stdin);

  struct ArrowIpcInputStream input;
  NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(ArrowIpcInputStreamInitFile(&input, file_ptr, false));

  struct ArrowArrayStream stream;
  NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(ArrowIpcArrayStreamReaderInit(&stream, &input, NULL));

  struct ArrowSchema schema;
  NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(stream.get_schema(&stream, &schema));

  struct ArrowArray array;
  while (true) {
    NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK(stream.get_next(&stream, &array));
    if (array.release == NULL) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Facilities for advanced usage are also provided via the low-level `ArrowIpcDecoder`,
which takes care of the details of deserializing the flatbuffer headers and
assembling buffers into an `ArrowArray`. The current implementation can read
schema and record batch messages that contain any Arrow type that supported by
the C data interface. The initial version can read both big and little endian
streams originating from platforms of either endian. Dictionary encoding and
compression are not currently supported.

## Getting started with nanoarrow

Early users of the nanoarrow C library respectfully noted that it was difficult
to know where to begin. This release includes improvements in reference documentation
but also includes a long-form tutorial for those just getting started with or
considering adopting the library. You can find the tutorial at the
[nanoarrow documentation site](https://apache.github.io/arrow-nanoarrow/dev/getting-started.html).

## C library

The nanoarrow 0.2.0 release also includes a number of bugfixes and improvements
to the core C library, many of which were identified as a result of usage
connected with development of the IPC extension.

- Helpers for extracting/appending `Decimal128` and `Decimal256` elements
  from/to arrays were added.
- The C library can now perform "full" validation to validate untrusted input
  (e.g., serialized IPC from the wire).
- The C library can now perform "minimal" validation that performs all checks
  that do not access any buffer data. This feature was added to facilitate
  future support for the `ArrowDeviceArray` that was recently added as the
  Arrow C device interface.
- Release verification on Ubuntu (x86_64, arm64), Fedora (x86_64),
  Archlinux (x86_64), Centos 7 (x86_64, arm64), Alpine (x86_64, arm64, s390x),
  Windows (x86_64), and MacOS (x86_64) were added to the continuous
  integration system. Linux verification is implemented using `docker compose`
  to facilitate local checks when developing features that may affect
  a specific platform.

## R bindings

The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the `nanoarrow` package on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). The 0.2.0 release of the R bindings includes
improvements in type support, improvements in stability, and features required
for the forthcoming release of Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) R bindings.
Notably:

- Support for conversion of union arrays to R objects was added to facilitate
  support for an ADBC function that returns such an array.
- Support for adding an R-level finalizer to an `ArrowArrayStream` was added
  to facilitate safely wrapping a stream resulting from an ADBC call at the
  R level.

## Python bindings?

The nanoarrow 0.2.0 release does not include Python bindings, but improvements to the
[unreleased draft bindings](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/python)
were added to facilitate discussion among Python developers regarding the useful
scope of a potential future nanoarrow Python package. If one of those developers is
you, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/new/choose)
or send a post to the
[developer mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@arrow.apache.org)
to engage in the discussion.

## Contributors

This initial release consists of contributions from 6 contributors in addition
to the invaluable advice and support of the Apache Arrow developer mailing list.

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 18.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**334 resolved issues**][1]
on [**530 distinct commits**][2] from [**89 distinct contributors**][2].
See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)
to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 17.0.0 release, Will Ayd and Rossi Sun have been invited to be committer.
No new members have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar format

The Arrow columnar format now allows 32-bit and 64-bit decimal data, in
addition to the already existing 128-bit and 256-bit decimal data types
(GH-43956).


## Arrow Flight RPC notes

The Java implementation now transparently handles compressed Arrow data when reading, instead of requiring explicit configuration. (GH-43469)
The Ruby bindings now support implementing DoPut on the server. (GH-43814)

## C++ notes

The default memory pool has changed to mimalloc on all platforms (GH-43254).
Previously, jemalloc was used by default on Linux. Using mimalloc by default
provides a more consistent experience across different platforms, and
makes configuration easier. It is expected that this might either increase
or decrease performance on user workloads that use the default memory pool;
please benchmark accordingly. Jemalloc can still be selected by setting
the [`ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/env_vars.html#envvar-ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL) environment variable to "jemalloc".

A new class `arrow::ArrayStatistics` has been added to encode basic statistics
about an Arrow array. It provides a source-agnostic representation for statistics
provided by third-party sources such as Parquet files (GH-41909).

The new Decimal32 and Decimal64 types have been made available (GH-43956).

Several canonical extension types have been implemented:
- the [Opaque](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#opaque) extension type (GH-43454);
- the [8-bit boolean](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#bit-boolean) extension type (GH-17682);
- the [UUID](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#uuid) extension type (GH-15058);
- the [JSON](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#json) extension type (GH-32538).

**Flight UCX is deprecated.** We plan to remove this experiment in the next couple of releases.

### Acero

- Enhanced the row-oriented representation by widening the offset type from 32-bit to 64-bit, resolving crashes and data corruption in aggregation and hash join on large datasets due to offset overflow (GH-43495).
- Improved ordered aggregation performance by reducing complexity from `O(n*m)` to `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` the number of segments in the batch (GH-44052).

### Compute

Casting between string-like and string-view-like types has been implemented (GH-42247).

### Dataset


### Filesystems

Writing small files to S3 can use a single S3 API call instead of three,
provided the new option `allow_delayed_open` is enabled (GH-40557).
Files larger than 5 MB still go through the regular multipart
upload mechanism.

Background writes are now implemented and enabled by default for the Azure
filesystem, dramatically improving the performance of writing to remote files
(GH-40036).

Finalization of the S3 filesystem layer should hopefully be more robust (GH-44071).

### Gandiva

LLVM 19.1 is now supported (GH-44222).

### GPU


### IPC

The seed corpus used for fuzzing the IPC reader has been improved, hopefully
helping make the IPC reader even more robust against corrupt or malicious
IPC streams (GH-38041).

### Parquet

A new command line utility `parquet-dump-footer` allows dumping the Thrift-encoded
footer metadata of a Parquet file, optionally scrubbing confidential data
(GH-42102). This is part of the effort to collect real-world Parquet metadata
so as to evaluate the efficiency of future improvements to the Parquet format.
Please see https://github.com/apache/parquet-benchmark for instructions to submit
footers representative of your own workloads.


## C# notes

- Partial support has been added for LargeBinary, LargeString and LargeList. The column sizes cannot exceed 2 GB in length. (GH-43266).
- Changes to Flight support were made for better control and compatibility, and to allow Flight Server to be hosted in pre-Kestrel versions of .NET (GH-43907, GH-43672, GH-41347).
- Support has been added for newly-defined types decimal32 and decimal64 (GH-44271).
- The import of sliced arrays through the C Data interface now works correctly. (GH-43267)
## Java notes

**Java 8 is no longer supported.** (GH-38051)

**Gandiva may not work in this release.** For details, please see [GH-43576](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43576).

Basic support for RunEndEncoded was added (GH-39982). The ListView/StringView vector implementations are now more complete, including C Data support (multiple issues).

Several APIs have been updated to accept `long` for addresses in preparation for FFM/large buffer support (GH-43902). We no longer expose `sun.misc.Unsafe` (GH-43479). We no longer ship the `shaded` flight-core JARs (GH-43217).

More options were added to the Dataset ScanOptions API (GH-28866).

## JavaScript notes
- Accessing individual rows in Tables or Structs should now be more performant ([GH-30863](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/30863)).

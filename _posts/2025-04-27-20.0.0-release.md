The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 19.0.0 release, Ed Seidl, Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Matthijs Brobbel
have been invited to become committers. Bryce Mecum, Ian Cook, Jacob Wujciak-Jens 
and Rok Mihevc have been invited to join the Project Management Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## C++ Notes

### Compute

We’ve added several new compute functions: inverse_permutation/scatter ([GH-44393](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44393)), pivot_wider/hash_pivot_wider ([GH-45269](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45269)), rank_normal ([GH-45572](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45572)), skew/kurtosis ([GH-45676](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45676)), and winsorize ([GH-45755](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45755)). 

### Acero

We've significantly improved the Hash Join in terms of overflow-safety ([GH-44513](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44513), [GH-45334](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45334), [GH-45506](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45506)), memory consumption (peak memory usage reduced by half: [GH-45551](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45551)), and performance (up to several dozen times faster: [GH-45611](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45611), [GH-45917](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45917)).

### Flight RPC

- The experimental Flight over UCX feature has been removed.
([#43296](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43296))

## C# Notes

- Added support for the `Ordered` and `AppMetaData` fields to FlightInfo ([#45753](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/45753))
- FlightClient can now be integrated with [Grpc.Net.ClientFactory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/clientfactory?view=aspnetcore-9.0) ([#45451](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45451))

## Linux Packaging Notes

https://apache.jfrog.io/ is still available but https://packages.apache.org/ is preferred because the latter uses the apache.org domain.

## Python Notes

Compatibility notes:
* Minimum supported Cython has been raised to 3 and higher [GH-45237](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45237) .
* A subset of deprecated APIs have been removed
  [GH-45680](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45680): 
   ``PARQUET_2_0`` [GH-45848](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45848),
   ``use_legacy_dataset`` [GH-44790](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44790),
   serialize/deserialize PyArrow C++ code [GH-43587](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43587) . 

New features:
* Large variable width types are supported in NumPy conversion
  [GH-35289](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35289).
* Biased/unbiased option are available in skew and kurtosis compute functions
  [GH-45733](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45733).
* Support for SAS token in the ``AzureFileSystem`` has been added
  [GH-45705](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45705).
* Interchange of  ``decimal32``, ``decimal64`` and ``decimal256`` data type objects between
  Pandas and PyArrow is now supported [GH-45582](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45582),
  [GH-45570](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45570).
* ``pyarrow.ArrayStatistics``and  ``pyarrow.Array.statistics()`` are added
  [GH-45457](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45457).
* Bindings for JSON streaming reader are added
  [GH-14932](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14932).
* Bindings for ``MemoryPool::total_bytes_allocated`` and ``MemoryPool::num_allocations`` are added.
  Also allocator-specific statistics can now be printed to stderr [GH-45358](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45358).
* A new ``maps_as_pydicts``parameter is introduced to ``to_pylist``, ``to_pydict`` and ``as_py``
  methods enabling deserialization into Python dictionary instead of list of tuples
  [GH-39010](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39010).

Other improvements:
*  Source (sdist) and binary distribution (wheels) are now uploaded to GitHub Releases
  [GH-45920](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45920).
* Cython code has been cleaned up as we now require at least Cython 3.0
  [GH-45433](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45433).
* Building of free-threaded wheels on Windows is enabled
  [GH-44421](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44421) .
*Wheels for Alpine Linux are now provided [GH-18036](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/18036) .


Relevant bug fixes:
* Pandas conversion roundtrip with bytes column names error is fixed
  [GH-44188](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44188).
* Exceptions are raised instead of showing segfaults when users try to instantiate internal Parquet
  metadata classes [GH-36628](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36628).

## R Notes

- Binary Arrays now inherit from `blob::blob` in addition to `arrow_binary` when
  [converted to R
  objects](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/data_types.html#translations-from-arrow-to-r).
  This change is the first step in eventually deprecating the `arrow_binary`
  class in favor of the `blob` class in the
  [`blob`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=blob) package (See
  [GH-45709](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45709)).

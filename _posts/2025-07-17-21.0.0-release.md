Management Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Release Highlights

## Arrow Flight RPC Notes

In C++ and Python, a new IPC reader option was added to force data buffers to be aligned based on the data type, making it easier to work with systems that expected alignment ([GH-32276](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/32276)). While this is not a Flight-specific option, it tended to occur with Flight due to implementation details. Also, C++ and Python are now consistent with other Flight implementations in allowing the schema of a `FlightInfo` to be omitted ([GH-37677](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37677)).

We have accepted a donation of an ODBC driver for Flight SQL from Dremio ([GH-46522](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46522)). Note that the driver is not usable in its current state and contributors are working on implementing the rest of the driver.

## C++ Notes

### Compute

The Cast function is now able to reorder fields when casting from one
struct type to another; the fields are matched by name, not by index (GH-45028).

Many compute kernels have been moved into a separate, optional, shared library
(GH-25025). This improves modularity for dependency management in the
application and reduces the Arrow C++ distribution size when the compute
functionality is not being used. Note that some compute functions, such as
the Cast function, will still be built for internal use in various Arrow components.

Better half-float support has been added to some compute functions:
`is_nan`, `is_inf`, `is_finite`, `negate`, `negate_checked`, `sign` (GH-45083);
`if_else`, `case_when`, `coalesce`, `choose`, `replace_with_mask`, `fill_null_forward`,
`fill_null_backward` (GH-37027); `run_end_encode`, `run_end_decode` (GH-46285).

Better decimal32 and decimal64 support has been added to some compute functions:
`run_end_encode`, `run_end_decode` (GH-46285).

A new function `utf8_zero_fill` acts like Python's `str.zfill` method by providing
a left-padding function that preserves the optional leading plus/minus sign (GH-46683).

Decimal sum aggregation now produces a decimal result with an increased precision
in order to reduce the risk of overflowing the result type (GH-35166).

### CSV

Reading Duration columns is now supported (GH-40278).

### Dataset

It is now possible to preserve order when writing a dataset multi-threaded.
The feature is disabled by default (GH-26818).

### Filesystems

The S3 filesystem can optionally be built into a separate DLL (GH-40343).

### Parquet

#### Encryption

A new `SecureString` class must now be used to communicate sensitive data (such as
secret keys) with Parquet encryption APIs. This class automatically wipes its
contents from memory when destroyed, unlike regular `std::string` (GH-31603).

#### Type support

The new VARIANT logical type is supported at a low level, and an extension type
`parquet.variant` is added to reflect such columns when reading them to Arrow
(GH-45937).

The UUID logical type is automatically converted to/from the `arrow.uuid`
canonical extension type when reading or writing Parquet data, respectively.

The GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY logical types are supported (GH-45522). They are
automatically converted to/from the corresponding GeoArrow extension type,
if it has been registered by GeoArrow. Geospatial column statistics are also
supported.

It is now possible to read BYTE_ARRAY columns directly as LargeBinary or BinaryView,
without any intermediate conversion from Binary. Similarly, those types can be
written directly to Parquet (GH-43041). This allows bypassing the 2 GiB data
per chunk limitation of the Binary type, and can also improve performance.
This also applies to String types when a Parquet column has the STRING logical type.

Similarly, LIST columns can now be read directly as LargeList rather than List.
This allows bypassing the 2^31 values per chunk limitation of regular List types
(GH-46676).

#### Other Parquet improvements

A new feature named Content-Defined Chunking improves deduplication of Parquet
files with mostly identical contents, by choosing data page boundaries based on
actual contents rather than a number of values. For that, it uses a rolling hash
function, and the min and max chunk size can be chosen. The feature is disabled by
default and can be enabled on a per-file basis in the Parquet `WriterProperties`
(GH-45750).

The `EncodedStatistics` of a column chunk are publicly exposed in `ColumnChunkMetaData`
and can be read faster than if decoded as `Statistics` (GH-46462).

SIMD optimizations for the BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT have been improved (GH-46788).

Reading FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY data has been made significantly faster (up to 3x
faster on some benchmarks). This benefits logical types such as FLOAT16 (GH-43891).

### Miscellaneous C++ changes

The `ARROW_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS` build option was removed, as `CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD`
usually provides more benefits while requiring less maintenance.

New data creation helpers `ArrayFromJSONString`, `ChunkedArrayFromJSONString`,
`DictArrayFromJSONString`, `ScalarFromJSONString` and `DictScalarFromJSONString`
are now exposed publicly. While not as high-performing as `BufferBuilder` and
the concrete `ArrayBuilder` subclasses, they allow easy creation of test
or example data, for example:

```c++
  ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(
      auto string_array,
      arrow::ArrayFromJSONString(arrow::utf8(), R"(["Hello", "World", null])"));
  ARROW_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(
      auto list_array,
      arrow::ArrayFromJSONString(arrow::list(arrow::int32()),
                                 "[[1, null, 2], [], [3]]"));
```

Some APIs were changed to accept `std::string_view` instead of `const std::string&`.
Most uses of those APIs should not be affected (GH-46551).

A new pretty-print option allows limiting element size when printing string
or binary data (GH-46403).

It is now possible to export `Tensor` data using
[DLPack](https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/) (GH-39294).

Half-float arrays can be properly diff'ed and pretty-printed (GH-36753).

Some header files in `arrow/util` that were not supposed to be exposed are
now made internal (GH-46459).

## C# Notes

- TODO: Note about future repo move plan. "This is the final release of the C# implementation of Arrow as part of the monorepo...etc.

## Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust Notes

The Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust Go projects have moved to separate repositories outside
the main Arrow [monorepo](https://github.com/apache/arrow).

- For notes on the latest release of the [Java
implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-java), see the latest [Arrow
Java changelog][7].
- For notes on the latest release of the [JavaScript
implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-js), see the latest [Arrow
JavaScript changelog][8].
- For notes on the latest release of the [Rust
  implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) see the latest [Arrow Rust
  changelog][5].
- For notes on the latest release of the [Go
implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-go), see the latest [Arrow Go
changelog][6].

## Linux Packaging Notes

We added support for AlmaLinux 10. You can use AlmaLinux 10 packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 like distributions too.

We dropped support for CentOS Stream 8 because it reached EOL on 2024-05-31.

## MATLAB Notes

### New Features

Added support for creating an `arrow.tabular.Table` from a list of `arrow.tabular.RecordBatch` instances ([GH-46877](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46877))

### Packaging

The MLTBX available in apache/arrow's GitHub Releases area was built against MATLAB R2025a.

[GH-46355](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/46355).
- Filtering all rows with ``RecordBatch.filter`` using an expression now returns
empty table with same schema instead of erroring
[GH-44366](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44366).

## Ruby and C GLib Notes

Here are updates both for Ruby and C GLib:

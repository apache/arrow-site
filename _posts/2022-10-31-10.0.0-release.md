## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A JDBC driver based on [Arrow Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html) is now available, courtesy of a code donation from Dremio ([ARROW-7744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7744)).
For more details, see ["Expanding Arrow's Reach with a JDBC Driver for Arrow Flight SQL"][flight-sql-jdbc].
Flight SQL is now supported in Go ([ARROW-17326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17326)).
Protocol definitions for transactions and [Substrait](https://substrait.io) plans were added to Flight SQL and are implemented in C++ and Java ([ARROW-17688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17688)).
General "best practices" documentation was added for C++ ([ARROW-17407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17407)).
The C++ implementation now has basic [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) integration ([ARROW-14958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14958)).

## C++ notes

### C++11 is no longer supported

The Arrow C++ codebase has moved to C++17 as its language compatibility
standard ([ARROW-17545](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17545)). This means Arrow C++, including its header files,
now requires a C++17-compliant compiler and standard library to be used.
Such compilers are widely available on most platforms.

Compatibility backports of C++14 and C++17 features, such as `std::string_view`
or `std::variant`, have been removed in favor of the standard library version
of these APIs ([ARROW-17546](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17546)). This will also make integration of Arrow C++
with other codebases easier.

It is expected that the Arrow C++ codebase will be gradually modernized to use
C++17 features in subsequent releases, when the need arises.

### Plasma is deprecated

The Plasma module is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### Compute / Acero

Extension types are now supported in hash joins ([ARROW-16695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16695)).

### Datasets

The fragments of a dataset can now be iterated in an asynchronous fashion,
using `Dataset::GetFragmentsAsync` ([ARROW-17318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17318)).

### Filesystems

It is now possible to configure a timeout policy for S3 ([ARROW-16521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16521)).

Error messages for S3 have been improved to give more context about the
error ([ARROW-17079](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17079)).

`GetFileInfoGenerator` has been optimized for local filesystems, with
dedicated options to tune chunking and readahead ([ARROW-17306](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17306)).

### JSON

Previously, the JSON reader could only read Decimal fields from JSON strings
(i.e. quoted). Now it can also read Decimal fields from JSON numbers as well
([ARROW-17847](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17847)).

### Parquet

Before Arrow 3.0.0, data pages version 2 were incorrectly written out, making
them unreadable with spec-compliant readers. A compatibility fix has been
introduced so that they can still be read with contemporary versions of
Arrow ([ARROW-17100](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17100)).

### Substrait

The Substrait consumer, which allows Substrait plans to be executed by the
Acero execution engine, has received some improvements:

* Aggregations are now supported ([ARROW-15591](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15591)).

* Conversion options have been added so that the level of compliance and
  rountrippability can be chosen when converting between Substrait and
  Acero representations of a plan ([ARROW-16988](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16988)).

* Support for many standard Substrait functions has been added
  ([ARROW-15582](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15582), [ARROW-17523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17523))

Some work has also been done in the reverse direction, to allow Acero execution
plans to be serialized as Substrait plans ([ARROW-16855](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16855)).

### Other changes

Our CMake package files have been overhauled ([ARROW-12175](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-12175)).  As a result,
namespaced targets are now exported, such as `Arrow::arrow_shared`.
Legacy (non-namespaced) names are still available, for example `arrow_shared`.

Compiling in release mode now uses `-O2`, not `-O3`, by default ([ARROW-17436](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17436)).

The RISC-V architecture is now recongnized at build time ([ARROW-17440](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17440)).

The PyArrow-specific C++ code was moved into the PyArrow source tree
(see below, [ARROW-16340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16340)). The `ARROW_PYTHON` CMake variable has been deprecated
and will be removed in a later release; you should instead enable the necessary
components explicitly ([ARROW-17868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17868)).

Some classes with a `Equals` method now also support `operator==` ([ARROW-6772](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6772)).
It was decided to only do this when equality is computationally cheap (i.e.
not on data collections such as Array, RecordBatch...).

## C# notes

#### Bug Fixes

* DecimalArray incorrectly appends values very large and very small values. ([ARROW-17223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13732))

## Gandiva notes

Gandiva has been migrated to use LLVM opaque pointer types, as typed
pointers had been deprecated ([ARROW-17790](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17790)).

## Go notes

* A new CI job has been added to run all of the tests with the `-asan` option using go1.18 ([ARROW-17324](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17324))
* Go now passes all integration tests on data types and IPC handling.
* The Go Arrow and Parquet packages now require go1.17+ ([ARROW-17646](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17646))

### Compute

The compute package that was importable via `github.com/apache/arrow/go/v9/arrow/compute` is now a separate module which requires go1.18+ (only the compute module, the rest of the packages still work fine under go1.17). ([ARROW-17456](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17456)).

Scalar and Vector kernel infrastructure has been implemented for performing compute operations providing the following functionality:

* casting Arrow Arrays from one type to another ([ARROW-17454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17454))
* Using Filter and Take functions on an Arrow Array, Record Batch, or Table ([ARROW-17669](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17669))

### Arrow

* Sparse and Dense Union Arrays have been implemented along with appropriate builders and data type support including in IPC reading and writing. ([ARROW-3678](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3678), [ARROW-17276](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17276)). This includes scalar types for Dense and Sparse union ([ARROW-17390](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17390))
* LargeBinary, LargeString and LargeList arrays have been implemented for handling arrays with 64-bit offsets. This also included fixing a bug so that binary builders are correctly resettable. ([ARROW-8226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8226), [ARROW-17275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17275))
* Support for Decimal256 arrays has been implemented ([ARROW-10600](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10600))
* Automatic Endianness Conversion for non-native endianness is now an option for IPC streams ([ARROW-17219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17219))
* CSV Writer now supports Timestamp, Date32 and Date64 types ([ARROW-17273](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17273))
* CSV Writer now supports custom formatting for boolean values ([ARROW-17277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17277))
* The Go Arrow Library now provides a FlightSQL client and server implementation ([ARROW-17326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17326)). An example server implementation is provided for a FlightSQL server using SQLite ([ARROW-17359](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17359))
* CSV Reader now supports schema type inference via NewInferringReader, along with options for specifying the type of some columns and skipping columns ([ARROW-17778](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17778))

### Parquet

* RowGroupReader.Column(index int) no longer panics if provided an invalid column index. Instead the signature has been changed to now return (PageReader, error) similar to other methods in the codebase. ([ARROW-17274](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17274))
* Bitpacking and other internal required implementations for ppc64le have been added for the Parquet library ([ARROW-17372](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17372))
* A bug has been fixed that caused inconsistent row information data from a table written by Athena ([ARROW-17453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17453))
* Fixed a bug that caused panics when writing a Nullable List of Structs ([ARROW-17169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17169))
* Key Value metadata in an Arrow Schema will be propagated to the Parquet file when using pqarrow even when not using StoreSchema ([ARROW-17627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17627))
* A memory leak when using statistics on ByteArray columns has been fixed ([ARROW-17573](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17573))


## Java notes
Many important features, enhancements, and bug fixes are included in this release, as are documentation enhancements, and a large number of improvements to build processes and project infrastructure. Selected highlights can be found below.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- JDBC Driver for Arrow Flight SQL ([13800](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13800))
- Initial implementation of immutable Table API ([14316](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14316))
- Substrait, transaction, cancellation for Flight SQL ([13492](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13492))
- Read Arrow IPC, CSV, and ORC files by NativeDatasetFactory ([13811](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13811), [13973](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13973), [14182](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14182))
- Add utility to bind Arrow data to JDBC parameters ([13589](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13589))

#### Build enhancements

- Add Windows build script that produces DLLs ([14203](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14203))
- C Data Interface and Dataset libraries can now be built with mvn commands ([13881](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13881), [13889](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13889))

#### Java notes: 

- Java Plasma JNI bindings have been deprecated ([14262](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14262))
## JavaScript notes
- No major changes.

## Python notes

Compatibility notes:

* Some deprecated APIs (deprecated at least since pyarrow 1.0.0) have been removed: the
  `RecordBatchReader.get_next_batch` method, `DataType.num_children` attribute, etc
  ([ARROW-17649](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17649)).
* When writing to Arrow IPC file format with `pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset` using
  `format="ipc"` or `format="arrow"`, the default extension for the resulting files is
  changed to `.arrow` instead of `.feather`. You can still use `format="feather"` to
  write identical files but using the `.feather` extension
  ([ARROW-17089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17089)).

New features and improvements:

* Filters in `pq.read_table()` can be passed as an expression in addition to the legacy
  list of tuples. For example, `filters=pc.field("col") < 4` is equivalent to
  `filters=[("col", "<", 4)]`
  ([ARROW-17483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17483)).
* The `batch_readahead` and `fragment_readahead` arguments for scanning Datasets are
  exposed in Python ([ARROW-17299](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17299)).
* ExtensionArrays can now be created from a storage array through the `pa.array(..)`
  constructor ([ARROW-17834](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17834)).
* Converting ListArrays containing ExtensionArray values to numpy or pandas works by
  falling back to the storage array
  ([ARROW-17813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17813)).
* The `pyarrow.substrait.run_query()` function gained a `table_provider` keyword to run
  the query against in-memory tables
  ([ARROW-17521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17521)).
* The `StructType` class gained a `field()` method to retrieve a child field
  ([ARROW-17131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17131)).
* Casting Tables to a new schema now honors the nullability flag in the target schema
  ([ARROW-16651](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16651)).
* Parquet files are now explicitly closed after reading
  ([ARROW-13763](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13763)).

Further, the Python bindings benefit from improvements in the C++ library
(e.g. new compute functions); see the C++ notes above for additional details.

**Build notes**

The PyArrow-specific C++ code, previously part of Arrow C++ codebase, is now integrated
into PyArrow. The tests are run automatically as part of the PyArrow test suite. See:
[ARROW-16340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16340),
[ARROW-17122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17122) and
[PyArrow C++ API notes](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/integration/extending.html#c-api)).

The build process is generally not affected by the change, but the `ARROW_PYTHON` CMake
variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release; you should instead
enable the necessary components explicitly
([ARROW-17868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17868)).

## R notes
Many improvements to Arrow dplyr queries are added in this version, including:

 * `dplyr::across()` can be used to apply the same computation across multiple columns;
 * long-running queries can now be cancelled;
 * the data source file name can be added as a column when reading multi-file datasets with `add_filename()`;
  * joins now support extension arrays;
 * and all supported Arrow dplyr functions are now documented on the [R documentation site][6].

For more on what’s in the 10.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

- Plasma binding has been deprecated ([ARROW-17864](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17864))

### C GLib

- Plasma binding has been deprecated ([ARROW-17862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17862))

## Rust notes

The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories outside the
main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Rust
implementation, see the latest [Arrow Rust changelog][5].

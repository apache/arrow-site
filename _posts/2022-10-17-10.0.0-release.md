## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

A JDBC driver based on [Arrow Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html) is now available, courtesy of a code donation from Dremio ([ARROW-7744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-7744)).
Flight SQL is now supported in Go ([ARROW-17326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17326)).
Protocol definitions for transactions and [Substrait](https://substrait.io) plans were added to Flight SQL and are implemented in C++ and Java ([ARROW-17688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17688)).
General "best practices" documentation was added for C++ ([ARROW-17407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17407)).
The C++ implementation now has basic [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) integration ([ARROW-14958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14958)).

## C++ notes

## C# notes

#### Bug Fixes

* DecimalArray incorrectly appends values very large and very small values. ([ARROW-17223](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13732))


## Go notes

* A new CI job has been added to run all of the tests with the `-asan` option using go1.18 ([ARROW-17324](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17324))
* Go now passes all integration tests on data types and IPC handling.
* The Go Arrow and Parquet packages now require go1.17+ ([ARROW-17646](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17646))

### Compute

The compute package that was importable via `github.com/apache/arrow/go/v9/arrow/compute` is now a separate module which requires go1.18+ (only the compute module, the rest of the packages still work fine under go1.17). ([ARROW-17456](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17456)).

Scalar and Vector kernel infrastructure has been implemented for performing compute operations providing the following functionality:

* casting Arrow Arrays from one type to another ([ARROW-17454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17454))
* Using Filter and Take functions on an Arrow Array, Record Batch, or Table ([ARROW-17669](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17669))

### Arrow

* Sparse and Dense Union Arrays have been implemented along with appropriate builders and data type support including in IPC reading and writing. ([ARROW-3678](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3678), [ARROW-17276](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17276)). This includes scalar types for Dense and Sparse union ([ARROW-17390](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17390))
* LargeBinary, LargeString and LargeList arrays have been implemented for handling arrays with 64-bit offsets. This also included fixing a bug so that binary builders are correctly resettable. ([ARROW-8226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-8226), [ARROW-17275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17275))
* Support for Decimal256 arrays has been implemented ([ARROW-10600](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10600))
* Automatic Endianness Conversion for non-native endianness is now an option for IPC streams ([ARROW-17219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17219))
* CSV Writer now supports Timestamp, Date32 and Date64 types ([ARROW-17273](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17273))
* CSV Writer now supports custom formatting for boolean values ([ARROW-17277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17277))
* The Go Arrow Library now provides a FlightSQL client and server implementation ([ARROW-17326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17326)). An example server implementation is provided for a FlightSQL server using SQLite ([ARROW-17359](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17359))
* CSV Reader now supports schema type inference via NewInferringReader, along with options for specifying the type of some columns and skipping columns ([ARROW-17778](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17778))

### Parquet

* RowGroupReader.Column(index int) no longer panics if provided an invalid column index. Instead the signature has been changed to now return (PageReader, error) similar to other methods in the codebase. ([ARROW-17274](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17274))
* Bitpacking and other internal required implementations for ppc64le have been added for the Parquet library ([ARROW-17372](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17372))
* A bug has been fixed that caused inconsistent row information data from a table written by Athena ([ARROW-17453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17453))
* Fixed a bug that caused panics when writing a Nullable List of Structs ([ARROW-17169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17169))
* Key Value metadata in an Arrow Schema will be propagated to the Parquet file when using pqarrow even when not using StoreSchema ([ARROW-17627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17627))
* A memory leak when using statistics on ByteArray columns has been fixed ([ARROW-17573](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17573))

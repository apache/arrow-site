# Introduction

With the recent release of version [32.0.0](https://crates.io/crates/arrow/32.0.0) of the Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), it seemed timely to highlight the some exciting work from the community since the [last update](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/06/16/rust-16.0.0/).

The most recent list of detailed changes can always be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), with the full historical list available [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG-old.md).

# Arrow

[arrow](https://crates.io/crates/arrow) and [arrow-flight](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight) are native Rust implementations of Apache Arrow. Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.

The [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) offers best in class performance,  memory safety, and the developer productivity of a modern programming language. These features make Rust an excellent choice for building modern high performance analytical systems. When combined, Rust and the Apache Arrow Ecosystem are a compelling toolkit for building the next generation of systems.

The [repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) recently passed 1300 stars on github, and the community has been focused on performance and feature completeness.


**Major Highlights**

* **New CSV and JSON Readers**: The CSV and JSON readers have been revamped. Their performance has more than doubled, and they now support push-driven parsing, and better streaming object storage integration.
* **Faster Build Times and Reduced Codegen**: The `arrow` crate has been split into multiple smaller crates, and large kernels have been moved behind optional feature flags. These changes allow downstream projects to choose a smaller dependency footprint and build times, if desired.
* **Support for Copy-On-Write**: Arrow arrays now support copy-on-write, [`into_builder`](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/array/struct.ArrayData.html#method.into_builder) methods
* **Comparable Row Format**: [Much faster  multi-column Sorting and Grouping](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-1/) is now possible with the the new spillable, comparable [row-format](https://docs.rs/arrow-row/32.0.0/arrow_row/index.html)
* **FlightSQL Support**: [FlightSQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html) [support](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/32.0.0/arrow_flight/sql/index.html) is now easie to implement with the addition higher-level APIs for clients and servers.
* **IPC File Compression**: Arrow IPC file [compression](https://docs.rs/arrow-ipc/32.0.0/arrow_ipc/gen/Message/struct.CompressionType.html) with ZSTD and LZ4 is not supported
* **Full Decimal Support**: 256-bit decimals and negative scales can be created and manipulated using many kernels, such as arithmetic.
* **Improved Dictionary Support**: Dictionaries are now transparently supported in most kernels.
* **Improved Temporal Support**: Timezones and other temporal kernels have been enhanced.
* **Improved Generics**: Improved generics allow writing code generic over all arrays, or all arrays with the same layout
* **Downcast Macros**: Various [helper](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/macro.downcast_primitive_array.html) [macros](https://docs.rs/arrow/32.0.0/arrow/macro.downcast_dictionary_array.html) are now available to simplify dynamic dispatch to statically typed implementations.

# Parquet

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk. The Apache Parquet implementation in Rust is one of the [fastest and most sophisticated ](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/) open source implementations available.


**Major Highlights**

* **Arbitrarily Nested Schema**: arbitrarily nested schemas can be read to and written from arrow, see [the blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/10/05/arrow-parquet-encoding-part-1/) for more information.
* **Predicate Pushdown**: the [arrow reader](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/index.html) now supports advanced predicate pushdown, including late materialization, as described in a [the blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/). See [RowSelection](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/arrow_reader/struct.RowSelection.html) for the code.
* **Bloom Filter Support**: support for both [reading and writing bloom filters](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/bloom_filter/index.html) has been added, thanks to @Jimexist and @viirya
* **Additional CLI Tools**: additional CLI tools have been added for introspecting and manipulating parquet data, thanks to @tustvold, @Jimexist, @crepererum and @bmmeijers

# Object Store

Modern analytic workloads increasingly make use of blob storage facilities, such as S3, to store large volumes of queryable data. Having a first-party Rust object storage abstraction, that can easily be combined with the arrow IO abstractions, is very compelling. As part of this, the [object_store](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/) crate was donated to the Apache Arrow project in July 2022, and you can read more about donation [here](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-object-store-donation/).

Whilst the object_store crate continues to follow a separate release schedule, it forms an integral part of the overarching Arrow IO story, and has also seen improvements since donation which are worth highlighting here.

**Major Highlights**

* **Streaming Upload**: Multipart uploads are now supported, thanks to @wjones127, @gruuya, @mildbyte and @askoa
* **Minimised dependency footprint**: Upstream SDKs are no longer used, improving consistency and reducing dependencies, thanks to @tustvold and @roeap
* **HTTP Support**: Arbitrary HTTP servers are now supported, as per the WebDAV specification, thanks to @tustvold
* **Advanced Networking**: Socks proxies, and advanced HTTP client configuration are now supported, thanks to @sum12 and @tustvold
* **Serializable Configuration**: Store configuration can now be serialized and deserialized, thanks to @roeap and @winding-lines
* **Advanced Authentication**: More authentication options have been added for the various cloud providers, thanks to @tustvold @roeap @winding-lines

# Contributors:

While some open source software can be created mostly by a single contributor, we believe the greatest software with the largest impact and reach is built around its community. Thus, Arrow is part of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) and our releases both past and present are a result of our amazing community's effort.

We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the arrow-rs repository since the `16.0.0` release. Keep up the great work, and we look forward to continued improvements:

_TODO: regenerate this once 32.0.0 release cut_

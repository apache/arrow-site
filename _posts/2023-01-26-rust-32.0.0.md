# Introduction

With the recent release of version 32.0.0 of the Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), it seemed timely to highlight some exciting things the community has been working on since the [last update](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/06/16/rust-16.0.0/).

The most recent set of changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), with the full historical list available [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG-old.md).

# Arrow

[arrow](https://crates.io/crates/arrow) and [arrow-flight](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight) are native Rust implementations of Apache Arrow. Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.

The [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) offers best in class performance,  memory safety, and the developer productivity of a modern programming language. These features make Rust an excellent choice for building modern high performance analytical systems. When combined, Rust and the Apache Arrow Ecosystem are a compelling toolkit for building the next generation of systems.

The repository has recently passed 1300 stars on github, and our community has been focusing on performance and feature completeness, with significant community contribution. 


**Major Highlights**

* **Multiple Crates**: The arrow crate has been split into multiple smaller crates, allowing for lighter depencies, thanks to @tustvold and @alamb
* **Reduced Codegen**: Expensive kernels have been moved behind optional feature flags to reduce executable size and build times, thanks to @tustvold
* **Copy-On-Write Support**: Arrow arrays now support copy-on-write, thanks to @viirya
* **Comparable Row Format**: A spillable, comparable row-format has been added enabling [incredibly fast multi-column sorts and grouping](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-1/), thanks to @tustvold
* **FlightSQL Support**: FlightSQL support is maturing, with the addition of higher-level APIs for clients and servers, thanks to @alamb, @tustvold, @viirya, @liukun4515, @Dandandan and @avantgardnerio
* ** Faster CSV/JSON Readers**: The CSV and JSON readers have been revamped, more than doubling performance, and facilitating object storage integration, thanks to @tustvold
* **IPC File Compression**: IPC file compression is now supported, thanks to @liukun4515 and @alamb
* **Improved Decimal Support**: 256-bit decimals and negative scales are now supported, along with better kernel support including arithmetic, thanks to @tustvold, @viirya, @waitingkuo, @liukun4515 and @HaoYang670
* **Improved Dictionary Support**: Dictionaries are now transparently supported in most kernels, thanks to @viirya
* **Improved Temporal Support**: The support for timezones and other temporal kernels has been significantly improved, thanks to @gaelwjl, @Jefffrey, @gruuya, @tustvod, @naosense, @ovr, @MazterQyou, @comphead and @waitingkuo
* **Improved Generics**: Improved generics allow writing code generic over all arrays, or all arrays with the same layout, thanks to @tustvold
* **Downcast Macros**: Various helper macros are provided to simplify dynamic dispatch to statically typed implementations, thanks to @tustvold

# Parquet

_TODO: Some pre-amble_

**Major Highlights**

* **Arbitrarily Nested Schema**: arbitrarily nested schemas can be read to and written from arrow, see [the blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/10/05/arrow-parquet-encoding-part-1/) for more information, thanks to @tustvold
* **Predicate Pushdown**: the arrow reader now supports advanced predicate pushdown, including late materialization, see [the blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/12/26/querying-parquet-with-millisecond-latency/) for more information, and see [RowSelection](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/arrow/arrow_reader/struct.RowSelection.html) for the code, thanks to @tustvold, @Ted-Jiang, @thinkharderdev, and @liukun4515
* **Bloom Filter Support**: support for both [reading and writing bloom filters](https://docs.rs/parquet/32.0.0/parquet/bloom_filter/index.html) has been added, thanks to @Jimexist and @viirya
* **Additional CLI Tools**: additional CLI tools have been added for introspecting and manipulating parquet data, thanks to @tustvold, @Jimexist, @crepererum and @bmmeijers

# Object Store

Modern analytic workloads increasingly make use of blob storage facilities, such as S3, to store large volumes of queryable data. Having a first-party Rust object storage abstraction, that can easily be combined with the arrow IO abstractions, is very compelling. As part of this, the [object_store](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/) crate was donated to the Apache Arrow project in July 2022, and you can read more about donation [here](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-object-store-donation/).

Whilst the object_store crate continues to follow a separate release schedule, it forms an integral part of the overarching Arrow IO story, and has also seen improvements since donation which are worth highlighting here.

**Major Highlights**

* **Streaming Upload**: Multipart uploads are now supported, thanks to @wjones127, @gruuya, @mildbyte and @askoa
* **Minimised dependency footprint**: Upstream SDKs are no longer used, improving consistency and reducing dependencies, thanks to @tustvold and @roeap
* **HTTP Support**: Arbitrary HTTP servers are now supported, as per the WebDAV specification, thanks to @tustvold
* **Advanced Networking**: Socks proxies, and advanced HTTP client configuration are now supported, thanks to @sum12 and @tustvold
* **Serializable Configuration**: Store configuration can now be serialized and deserialized, thanks to @roeap and @winding-lines
* **Advanced Authentication**: More authentication options have been added for the various cloud providers, thanks to @tustvold @roeap @winding-lines

# Contributors:

While some open source software can be created mostly by a single contributor, we believe the greatest software with the largest impact and reach is built around its community. Thus, Arrow is part of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) and our releases both past and present are a result of our amazing community's effort.

We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the arrow-rs repository since the `16.0.0` release. Keep up the great work, and we look forward to continued improvements:

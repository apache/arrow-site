We recently released the 5.0.0 Rust version of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) which coincides with the [Arrow 5.0.0 release](https://arrow.apache.org/release/5.0.0.html). This post highlights some of the improvements in the Rust implementation. The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

The Rust Arrow implementation would not be possible without the wonderful work and support of our community, and the 5.0.0 release is no exception. It includes 161 commits from 34 individual contributors, many of them with their first contribution. Thank you all very much.

# Arrow
Feature-wise, this release adds:
1. A [new kernel](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/424) which lexicographically partitions points.
2. [Expanded support](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/439) for the FFI/[C data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html), easing integration with the broader Arrow ecosystem
3. Usability enhancements for creating and manipulating `RecordBatch`es.
4. [Improved usability](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/377) for Arrow Flight's API.
5. Slimmer dependency stack when default features are disabled

We continue to leverage the Rust ecosystem to deliver reliable and performant code. We made significant progress towards running the Rust test suite under the [MIRI checker](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) (a sort of valgrind for Rust) for memory access violations, and we expect it to be fully enabled in CI for the 5.1.0 release.

Of course, this release also contains bug fixes, performance improvements, and improved documentation examples. For the full list of changes, please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

# Parquet
The `parquet-derive` crate now automatically derives the required parquet schema, and the `parquet` crate had several bug fixes and enhancements.

# More Frequent Releases
Arrow releases major versions every three months. The Rust implementation has been experimenting with releasing minor version updates to speed the flow of new features and fixes. By implementing a new development process, as described in [A New Development Workflow for Arrow's Rust Implementation](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2021/05/04/rust-dev-workflow/) we have successfully created 4 minor releases on the 4.x.x line every other week without any reports of breakage.

You can always find the latest releases on crates.io: [`arrow`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow), [`parquet`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet), [`arrow-flight`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight), and [`parquet-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet-derive).

# DataFusion & Ballista
[DataFusion](https://docs.rs/datafusion/4.0.0/datafusion/) is an in-memory query engine with DataFrame and SQL APIs, built on top of Arrow. Ballista is a distributed compute platform. These projects are now in their [own repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion), and are no longer released in lock-step with Arrow. Expect further news in this area soon.

# Roadmap for 6.0.0 and Beyond
Here are some of the initiatives that contributors are currently working on for future releases:

* Improved performance of compute kernels
* Date/time/timestamp/interval compute kernels
* MapArray support
* Preparations for removing the use of `unsafe` to make arrow faster and more secure -- see the [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/recac1f6dc982bab2923f8fb6992e2d4c927f46daff5f03ed6c4de19c%40%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E) discussion for more details.

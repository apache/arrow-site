The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 3.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**666 resolved issues**][1]
from [**106 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].


## Columnar Format Notes

The Decimal256 data type, which was already supported by the Arrow columnar
format specification, is now implemented in C++ and Java (ARROW-9747).

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

Authentication in C++/Java/Python has been overhauled, allowing more flexible authentication methods and use of standard headers.
Support for cookies has also been added.
The C++/Java implementations are now more permissive when parsing messages in order to interoperate better with other Flight implementations.

A basic Flight implementation for C#/.NET has been added.
See the [implementation status matrix](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html#flight-rpc) for details.
## C++ notes

The default memory pool can now be changed at runtime using the environment
variable `ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL` (ARROW-11009).  The environment variable
is inspected at process startup.  This is useful when trying to diagnose memory
consumption issues with Arrow.

STL-like iterators are now provided over concrete arrays. Those are useful for
non-performance critical tasks, for example testing (ARROW-10776).

It is now possible to concatenate dictionary arrays with unequal dictionaries.
The dictionaries are unified when concatenating, for supported data types
(ARROW-5336).

Threads in a thread pool are now spawned lazily as needed for enqueued
tasks, up to the configured capacity. They used to be spawned upfront on
creation of the thread pool (ARROW-10038).

### Compute layer

Comprehensive documentation for compute functions is now available:
https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html

Compute functions for string processing have been added for:
* spliting on whitespace (ASCII and Unicode flavours) and splitting on a
  pattern (ARROW-9991);
* trimming characters (ARROW-9128).

Behavior of the `index_in` and `is_in` compute functions with nulls has been
changed for consistency (ARROW-10663).

Multiple-column sort kernels are now available for tables and record batches
(ARROW-8199, ARROW-10796, ARROW-10790).

Performance of table filtering has been vastly improved (ARROW-10569).

Scalar arguments are now accepted for more compute functions.

Compute functions `quantile` (ARROW-10831) and `is_nan` (ARROW-11043) have been
added for numeric data.

Aggregation functions `any` (ARROW-1846) and `all` (ARROW-10301) have been
added for boolean data.
### Dataset

The `Expression` hierarchy has simplified to a wrapper around literals, field references,
or calls to named functions. This enables usage of any compute function while filtering
with no bolierplate.

Parquet statistics are lazily parsed in `ParquetDatasetFactory` and
`ParquetFileFragment` for shorter construction time.

### CSV

Conversion of string columns is now faster thanks to faster UTF-8 validation
of small strings (ARROW-10313).

Conversion of floating-point columns is now faster thanks to optimized
string-to-double conversion routines (ARROW-10328).

Parsing of ISO8601 timestamps is now more liberal: trailing zeros can
be omitted in the fractional part (ARROW-10337).

Fixed a bug where null detection could give the wrong results on some platforms
(ARROW-11067).

Added type inference for Date32 columns for values in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`
(ARROW-11247).

### Feather

Fixed reading of compressed Feather files written with Arrow 0.17 (ARROW-11163).

### Filesystem layer

S3 recursive tree walks now benefit from a parallel implementation, where reads
of multiple child directories are now issued concurrently (ARROW-10788).

Improved empty directory detection to be mindful of differences between Amazon
and Minio S3 implementations (ARROW-10942).

### Flight RPC

IPv6 host addresses are now supported (ARROW-10475).

### IPC

It is now possible to emit dictionary deltas where possible using the IPC
stream writer. This is governed by a new variable in the `IpcWriteOptions` class
(ARROW-6883).

It is now possible to read wider tables, which used to fail due to reaching a
limit during Flatbuffers verification (ARROW-10056).

### Parquet

Fixed reading of LZ4-compressed Parquet columns emitted by the Java Parquet
implementation (ARROW-11301).

Fixed a bug where writing multiple batches of nullable nested strings to Parquet
would not write any data in batches after the first one (ARROW-10493)

The Decimal256 data type can be read from and written to Parquet (ARROW-10607).

LargeString and LargeBinary data can now be written to Parquet (ARROW-10426).

## C# notes

The .NET package added initial support for Arrow Flight clients and servers. Support is enabled through two new NuGet packages [Apache.Arrow.Flight](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Arrow.Flight/) (client) and [Apache.Arrow.Flight.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Arrow.Flight.AspNetCore/) (server).

Also fixed an issue where ArrowStreamWriter wasn't writing schema metadata to Arrow streams.

## Go notes

## Java notes

## JavaScript notes
## Julia notes

This is the first release to officially include
[an implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/julia/Arrow)
for the Julia language. The pure Julia implementation includes support
for [wide coverage of the format specification](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html).
Additional details can be found in the
[julialang.org blog post](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/arrow/).

## Python notes

Support for Python 3.9 was added (ARROW-10224), and support for Python 3.5
was removed (ARROW-5679).

Support for building manylinux1 packages has been removed (ARROW-11212).
PyArrow continues to be available as manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 wheels.

The minimal required version for NumPy is now 1.16.6. Note that when upgrading
NumPy to 1.20, you also need to upgrade pyarrow to 3.0.0 to ensure compatibility.

Compute functions are now automatically exported from C++ to the `pyarrow.compute`
module, and they have docstrings matching their C++ definition.

An `iter_batches()` method is now available for reading a Parquet file iteratively
(ARROW-7800).

Alternate memory pools (such as mimalloc, jemalloc or the C malloc-based memory
pool) are now available from Python (ARROW-11049).

Fixed a potential deadlock when importing pandas from several threads (ARROW-10519).

Fixed a compatibility issue with Numpy 1.20 (ARROW-10833).

## R notes

This release contains new features for the Flight RPC wrapper, better
support for saving R metadata (including `sf` spatial data) to Feather and
Parquet files, several significant improvements to speed and memory management,
and many other enhancements.

For more on whatâ€™s in the 3.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

In Ruby binding, 256-bit decimal support and `Arrow::FixedBinaryArrayBuilder` are added likewise C GLib below.

### C GLib

In the version 3.0.0 of C GLib consists of many new features.

A chunked array, a record batch, and a table support `sort_indices` function as well as an array.
These functions including array's support to specify sorting option.
`garrow_array_sort_to_indices` has been renamed to `garrow_array_sort_indices` and the previous name has been deprecated.

`GArrowField` supports functions to handle metadata.
`GArrowSchema` supports `garrow_schema_has_metadata()` function.

`GArrowArrayBuilder` supports to add single null, multiple nulls, single empty value, and multiple empty values.
`GArrowFixedSizedBinaryArrayBuilder` is newly supported.

256-bit decimal and extension types are newly supported.
Filesystem module supports Mock, HDFS, S3 file systems.
Dataset module supports CSV, IPC, and Parquet file formats.

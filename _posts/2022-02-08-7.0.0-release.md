The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 7.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**617 resolved issues**][1]
from [**105 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 6.0.1 release, Rémi Dattai and Alessandro Molina have been invited to be committers.
Daniël Heres and Yibo Cai have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC).
Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

The Flight specification has been clarified to note that schemas are expected to be IPC-encapsulated on the wire.

Documentation has been generally improved; see the [Arrow Cookbook](https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/) for recipes on how to use Flight in Python and R, and a new [example](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/examples/arrow/flight_grpc_example.cc) on how to use Flight and gRPC services on the same port.

This release includes Arrow Flight SQL, a protocol for using Arrow Flight to execute queries against and fetch metadata from SQL databases. Support is included for C++ and Java (but *not* languages that bind to C++, like Python or R). A more detailed blog post is forthcoming (_EDIT_ 2022/02/16: see the [Flight SQL announcement]({% link _posts/2022-02-16-introducing-arrow-flight-sql.md %})). Note that development is ongoing and the specification is currently experimental.

## C++ notes

A set of CMake presets has been added to ease building Arrow in a number
of cases (ARROW-14678, ARROW-14714).

The `arrow::BitUtil` namespace has been renamed to `arrow::bit_util`
(ARROW-13494).

Concatenation of union arrays is now supported (ARROW-4975).

`StructType` gained three convenience methods to add, change and remove
a given field (ARROW-11424).

The `Datum` kind `COLLECTION` has been removed as it was entirely unused
in the codebase (ARROW-13598).

### Compute Layer

A number of compute functions have been added:

- functions operating on strings: "binary_reverse" (ARROW-14306),
  "string_repeat" (ARROW-12712), "utf8_normalize" (ARROW-14205);
- "fill_null_forward", "fill_null_backward" (ARROW-1699);
- "ceil_temporal", "floor_temporal", "round_temporal" to adjust temporal input
  to an integral multiple of a given unit (ARROW-14822);
- "year_month_day" to extract the calendar components of the input (ARROW-15032);
- "random" to general random floating-point values between 0 and 1 (ARROW-12404);
- "indices_nonzero" to return the indices in the input where there are
  non-zero, non-null values (ARROW-13035).

Decimal data is now supported as input of the arithmetic kernels
(ARROW-13130).

Dictionary data is now supported as input of the hash join execution node
(ARROW-14181).

Residual predicates have been implemented in the hash join node
(ARROW-13643).

The "list_parent_indices" function now always returns int64 data
regardless of the input type (ARROW-14592).

Month-day-nano interval data is now supported as input of the same functions
as other interval types (ARROW-13989).

### CSV

The CSV writer got additional configuration options:
- the string representation of null values (ARROW-14905);
- the quoting strategy: always / never / as needed (ARROW-14905);
- the end of line character(s) (ARROW-14907)

### Dataset Layer

[Skyhook]({% link _posts/2022-01-31-skyhook-bringing-computation-to-storage-with-apache-arrow.md %}),
a dataset addition that offloads fragment scan operations to a
Ceph distributed storage cluster, was contributed (ARROW-13607).

The dataset writer now exposes options `min_rows_per_group` and
`max_rows_per_group` to control the size of row groups created (ARROW-14426).

### IO and Filesystem Layer

A critical bug in the AWS SDK for C++ that risks losing data in S3 multipart
uploads has been circumvented (ARROW-14523).

The Google Cloud Storage filesystem is now featureful enough to pass all
generic filesystem tests (ARROW-14924).

The OpenAppendStream method of filesystems has been un-deprecated; however,
it still cannot be implemented for all filesystem backends (ARROW-14969).

A new function `arrow::fs::ResolveS3BucketRegion` allows resolving the
region where a particular S3 bucket resides (ARROW-15165).

The S3 filesystem now sets the Content-Type of output files to
"application/octet-stream" (instead of "application/xml" previously)
if not explicitly specified by the caller (ARROW-15306).

### IPC

Fine-grained I/O (coalescing) is now enabled in the synchronous (ARROW-12683)
and asynchronous (ARROW-14577) IPC reader.

It is now possible to set the compression level when using LZ4 compression
(ARROW-9648).

### ORC

The ORC adapters have been significantly improved. A lot more properties of the ORC reader as well as ORC writer options are now available. Moreover API docs for both the ORC reader and the ORC writer have been generated.  (ARROW-11297)
### Parquet

DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY-encoded data can now be read from (but not written to)
bytearray columns in Parquet files (PARQUET-492).

## Go notes

### Arrow

#### Bug Fixes

* License lifted up a level so that it is properly detected for the github.com/apache/arrow/go/v7 module for pkg.go.dev [ARROW-14728](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11715). Documentation on pkg.go.dev will look correct with complete major version handling as of the v7.0.0 release.
* Errors from `MessageReader.Message` get properly surfaced by `Reader.Read` [ARROW-14769](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11739)
* `ipc.Reader` properly uses the allocator it is initialized with instead of making native byte slices [ARROW-14717](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11712)
* Fixed a CI issue where the CGO tests were crashing on windows [ARROW-14589](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11611)
* Various fixes for internal usages of `Release` and `Retain` to maintain proper management of reference counting.

#### Enhancements

* Continuous Integration for Go library now uses Go1.16 as the version being tested [ARROW-14985](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11860)
* `ValueOffsets` function added to `array.String` to return the entire slice of offsets [ARROW-14645](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11653)
* `array.Interface` has been lifted to `arrow.Array`, `array.{Record,Column,Chunked,Table}` have been lifted to `arrow.{Record,Column,Chunked,Table}`. Interface `arrow.ArrayData` has been created to be used instead of `array.Data`. Aliases have been provided for the `array` package so existing code that doesn't directly use `array.Data` shouldn't be affected. The aliases will be removed in v8. [ARROW-5599](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11832). The `Chunked.NewSlice` method has been removed and is replaced by the `array.NewChunkedSlice` function.
* Arrays and Records now support marshalling to JSON via the `json.Marshaller` interface. Builders support adding values to them by unmarshalling from JSON via the `json.Unmarshaller` interface. `array.FromJSON` function added to create Arrays from JSON directly. [ARROW-9630](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11359)
* Basic handling of field referencing and expression building similar to the C++ Compute APIs added through the new `compute` package in preparation for adding compute interfaces. Does not yet allow *executing* expressions. [ARROW-14430](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11514)

### Parquet

#### Enhancements

* Updated dependency versions [ARROW-14462](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11537)
* `file` module added, Go Parquet library now supports full file reading and writing. [ARROW-13984](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11146) [ARROW-13986](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11538). Does not yet provide direct Parquet <--> Arrow conversions.
* Internal min_max utility functions given Arm64 NEON SIMD optimized assembly, gaining a 4x - 6x performance improvement. [ARROW-15536](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12163)

## Java notes

* Flight SQL support is now available in the Java library, with integration tests to verify it against the C++ reference implementation.
* `GeneralOutOfPlaceVectorSorter` is now available for sorting any kind of vector. In general if dedicated sorters can be used (like `FixedWidthInPlaceVectorSorter`) they should preferred as they will generally perform better.
* `log4j2` dependency was removed as it was unused and a possible vector for attacks
* `VectorSchemaRootAppender` now works with `BitVector`

## JavaScript notes

* Major simplifications to the API. There is only a single Vector class now. See the (also much improved) docs for details.
* Dictionary vectors created with `vectorFromArray` are automatically cached for better performance.
* Better tree shaking support. Some bundles can now be only a few kb.

## Python notes

* Official support for Python 3.6 has been dropped.
* `random` and `indices_nonzero` compute functions are now supported in Python
* `pyarrow.orc.read_table` is now provided to easily read the content of ORC files to a Table.
* `pyarrow.orc.ORCFile` now has a lot more properties exposed.
* `pyarrow.orc.ORCWriter` and `pyarrow.orc.write_table` now have the writer options available.
* `pyarrow.orc` now has much better API documentation.
* Support for compute functions arguments and options has been improved in general,  arguments are not position only, while options can be provided as keyword args or not, and error reporting for wrong arguments has been improved.
* `Table` now has a `group_by` method that allows to perform aggregations on table data. The compute functions documentation has also been improved to better distinguish between standard compute functions and `HASH_AGGREGATE` compute functions that can only be using for aggregations.
* Python documentation now provides interlinking for references to parameter types and return values, thus making far easier to navigate the documentation.

## R notes

This release adds additional improvements to the `dplyr` interface, to CSV support, and to the C-Data interface to exchange data with other languages. For more details, see the [complete R changelog][4].

## Rust notes

Rust releases minor versions every 2 weeks in addition to a major
version with the rest of the Arrow language implementations. Thus most
enhancements have been incrementally released over the last 3 months
as part of the 6.x.

Going forward, the Rust implementation version will start deviating
from the rest of the Arrow implementations, incrementing a major
version if the changes to the crate require it. We still plan a
release every other week. Please see issue [#1120](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1120)
for more details

Major changes in the 7.0.0 release include:
1. Additional support for `Decimal`
2. More ergonomic compute kernels that take `dyn Array`
3. `Union` type now follows the latest Arrow standard
4. Support for custom datetime format for inference and parsing CSV files

Another highlight is that the community continues to improve the
safety of the arrow crate. The 6.4.0 release included complete data
validation and has resolved all outstanding RUSTSEC issues against the
crate.

For additional details on the 7.0.0
Rust implementation, please see the [Arrow Rust CHANGELOG][5]

## Introduction

We recently [released DataFusion 34.0.0]. This blog highlights some of the major
improvements since we [released DataFusion 26.0.0] (spoiler alert there are many)
and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months.

[released DataFusion 26.0.0]: https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/06/24/datafusion-25.0.0/.
[released DataFusion 34.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/34.0.0

[Apache Arrow DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion‚Äôs primary design
goal] is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library] and
[command line SQL tool].

This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future
updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to [graduate
to a top level project] (Apache Arrow DataFusion ‚Üí Apache DataFusion!) which
will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our [first
DataFusion in person meetup] is planned for March 2024.

DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a
community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as
individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between `26.0.0` and
`34.0.0`, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a
thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517
of them.
You can find a list of all changes in the detailed [CHANGELOG].

# Improved Performance üöÄ 

Performance is a key feature of DataFusion, DataFusion is 
more than 2x faster on [ClickBench] compared to version `25.0.0`, as shown below:

<!--

Here are some specific enhancements we have made to improve performance:
* [2-3x better aggregation performance with many distinct groups]
* Partially ordered grouping / streaming grouping
* [Specialized operator for "TopK" `ORDER BY LIMIT XXX`] 
* [Specialized operator for `min(col) GROUP BY .. ORDER by min(col) LIMIT XXX`]
* [Improved join performance]
* Eliminate redundant sorting with sort order aware optimizers

# New Features ‚ú®

## DML / Insert / Creating Files

DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple
files, using `Parquet`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `ARROW` and user defined formats.
[Benchmark results] show improvements up to 5x in some cases.

[Benchmark results]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7655

Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any [`ObjectStore`]
implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local
files, and user defined implementations. While reading from [hive style
partitioned tables] has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such
tables as well.

[hive style partitioned tables]: https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/listing/struct.ListingTable.html#features

[`ObjectStore`]: https://docs.rs/object_store/0.9.0/object_store/index.html

For example, to write to a local file:

```sql
‚ùØ CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE awesome_table(x INT) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '/tmp/my_awesome_table';
0 rows in set. Query took 0.003 seconds.

‚ùØ INSERT INTO awesome_table SELECT x * 10 FROM my_source_table;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 3     |
+-------+
1 row in set. Query took 0.024 seconds.
```

[`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/ddl.html#create-external-table

You can also write to files with the [`COPY`], similarly to [DuckDB‚Äôs `COPY`]:

[`COPY`]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/dml.html#copy
[DuckDB‚Äôs `COPY`]: https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/copy.html

```sql
‚ùØ COPY (SELECT x + 1 FROM my_source_table) TO '/tmp/output.json';
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 3     |
+-------+
1 row in set. Query took 0.014 seconds.
```

```shell
$ cat /tmp/output.json
{"x":1}
{"x":2}
{"x":3}
```

## Improved `STRUCT` and `ARRAY` support

DataFusion `34.0.0` has much improved `STRUCT` and `ARRAY`
support, including a full range of [struct functions] and [array functions].

[struct functions]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/scalar_functions.html#struct-functions
[array functions]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/scalar_functions.html#array-functions

<!--
‚ùØ create table my_table as values ([1,2,3]), ([2]), ([4,5]);
--> 

For example, you can now use `[]` syntax and `array_length` to access and inspect arrays:
```sql
‚ùØ SELECT column1, 
         column1[1] AS first_element, 
         array_length(column1) AS len 
  FROM my_table;
+-----------+---------------+-----+
| column1   | first_element | len |
+-----------+---------------+-----+
| [1, 2, 3] | 1             | 3   |
| [2]       | 2             | 1   |
| [4, 5]    | 4             | 2   |
+-----------+---------------+-----+
```

```sql
‚ùØ SELECT column1, column1['c0'] FROM  my_table;
+------------------+----------------------+
| column1          | my_table.column1[c0] |
+------------------+----------------------+
| {c0: foo, c1: 1} | foo                  |
| {c0: bar, c1: 2} | bar                  |
+------------------+----------------------+
2 rows in set. Query took 0.002 seconds.
```

## Other Features
Other notable features include:
* Support aggregating datasets that exceed memory size, with [group by spill to disk]
* All operators now track and limit their memory consumption, including Joins

[group by spill to disk]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7400

# Building Systems is Easier with DataFusion üõ†Ô∏è

## Documentation
It is easier than ever to get started using DataFusion with the
new [Library Users Guide] as well as significantly improved the [API documentation]. 

[Library Users Guide]:https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/index.html
[API documentation]: https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/index.html

## User Defined Window and Table Functions
In addition to DataFusion's [User Defined Scalar Functions], and [User Defined Aggregate Functions], DataFusion now supports [User Defined Window Functions] 
 and [User Defined Table Functions].

For example, [the `datafusion-cli`] implements a DuckDB style [`parquet_metadata`]
function as a user defined table function ([source code here]): 

[the `datafusion-cli`]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html
[`parquet_metadata`]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html#supported-sql
[source code here]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/3f219bc929cfd418b0e3d3501f8eba1d5a2c87ae/datafusion-cli/src/functions.rs#L222-L248

```sql
‚ùØ SELECT 
      path_in_schema, row_group_id, row_group_num_rows, stats_min, stats_max, total_compressed_size 
FROM 
      parquet_metadata('hits.parquet')
WHERE path_in_schema = '"WatchID"' 
LIMIT 3;

+----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| path_in_schema | row_group_id | row_group_num_rows | stats_min           | stats_max           | total_compressed_size |
+----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| "WatchID"      | 0            | 450560             | 4611687214012840539 | 9223369186199968220 | 3883759               |
| "WatchID"      | 1            | 612174             | 4611689135232456464 | 9223371478009085789 | 5176803               |
| "WatchID"      | 2            | 344064             | 4611692774829951781 | 9223363791697310021 | 3031680               |
+----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
3 rows in set. Query took 0.053 seconds.

### Growth of DataFusion üìà
DataFusion has been appearing more publically in the wild. For example
* New projects built using DataFusion such as [lancedb], [GlareDB], [Arroyo], and [optd].
* Public talks such as [Apache Arrow Datafusion: Vectorized
  Execution Framework For Maximum Performance] in [CommunityOverCode Asia 2023] 
* Blogs posts such as [Apache Arrow, Arrow/DataFusion, AI-native Data Infra],
  [Flight, DataFusion, Arrow, and Parquet: Using the FDAP Architecture to build InfluxDB 3.0], and 
  [A Guide to User-Defined Functions in Apache Arrow DataFusion]

We have also [submitted a paper] to [SIGMOD 2024], one of the
premiere database conferences, describing DataFusion in a technically formal
style and making the case that it is possible to create a modular and extensive query engine 
without sacrificing performance. We hope this paper helps people 
evaluating DataFusion for their needs understand it better.

# DataFusion in 2024 ü•≥

Some major initiatives from contributors we know of this year are:

1. *Modularity*: Make DataFusion even more modular, such as [unifying
   built in and user functions], making it easier to customize 
   DataFusion's behavior.

2. *Community Growth*: Graduate to our own top level Apache project, and
   subsequently add more committers and PMC members to keep pace with project
   growth.

5. *Use case white papers*: Write blog posts and videos explaining
   how to use DataFusion for real-world use cases.

3. *Testing*: Improve CI infrastructure and test coverage, more fuzz
   testing, and better functional and performance regression testing.

3. *Planning Time*: Reduce the time taken to plan queries, both [wide
   tables of 1000s of columns], and in [general].

4. *Aggregate Performance*: Improve the speed of [aggregating "high cardinality"] data
   when there are many (e.g. millions) of distinct groups.

5. *Statistics*: [Improved statistics handling] with an eye towards more
   sophisticated expression analysis and cost models.

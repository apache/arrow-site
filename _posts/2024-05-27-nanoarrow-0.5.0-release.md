The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.5.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 79 resolved issues from
9 contributors.

## Release Highlights

The primary focus of the nanoarrow 0.5.0 release was expanding the
initial [Python bindings](#python-bindings) that were released in 0.4.0.
The nanoarrow Python package can now create and consume most Arrow
data types, arrays, and array streams, including conversion to/from
objects compatible with the Python buffer protocol and conversion
to/from lists of Python objects.

The nanoarrow 0.5.0 release also includes updates to its build
configuration to make it possible to use nanoarrow with `FetchContent`
in projects with a wider variety of CMake usage. In addition to CMake,
nanoarrow now supports the Meson build system. Thanks to
[@vyasr](https://github.com/vyasr) and [@WillAyd](https://github.com/WillAyd)
for contributing these changes!

In the [R bindings](#r-bindings), support for reading IPC streams
is now accessible with `read_nanoarrow()`!

Finally, build system helpers and helpers to reconcile modern C++ usage
with nanorrow C structures (e.g., iterating over an `ArrowArrayStream` or
`ArrowArray` using a range-for loop) were added to `nanoarrow.hpp`.
Thanks to [@bkeitz](https://github.com/bkietz) for contributing these
changes!

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.5.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

## Breaking Changes

Most changes included in the nanoarrow 0.5.0 release will not break downstream
code; however, several changes in the C library are breaking changes to previous
behaviour.

- `ArrowBufferResize()` and `ArrowBitmapResize()` now adjust `size_bytes`/
  `size_bits` in addition to `capacity_bytes`/`buffer.capacity_bytes`.
  Preivously these functions only adjusted the capacity of the underlying
  buffer which caused some understandable confusion even though this
  behaviour was documented. This change affects all usage of
  `ArrowBufferReisze()` and `ArrowBitmapResize()` that *increased* the size
  of the underlying buffer (i.e., usage where `shrink_to_fit` was non zero
  should be unaffected).
- `ArrowBufferReset()` now *always* calls the allocator's `free()` callback.
  Previously, a call to the `free()` callback was skipped if the pointer was
  `NULL`; however, this led to some confusion and made it easy to accidentally
  leak a custom deallocator whose pointer happened to be `NULL`.
- As a consequence of the above, it is now mandatory to call `ArrowBufferInit()`
  before calling `ArrowBufferReset()`. There was some existing usage of nanoarrow
  that zero-ed the memory for an `ArrowBuffer` and then (sometimes) called
  `ArrowBufferReset()`. Preivously this was a no-op; however, after 0.5.0 this
  will crash. This is consistent with other structures in the nanoarrow C library
  (which require an initialization before it is safe to reset/release them).


### Python bindings

The nanoarrow Python bindings are distributed as the `nanoarrow` package on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nanoarrow/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nanoarrow):

```shell
pip install nanoarrow
conda install nanoarrow -c conda-forge
```

High level users can use the `Schema`, `Array`, and `ArrayStream` classes
to interact with data types, arrays, and array streams:

```python
import nanoarrow as na

na.int32()
#> <Schema> int32

na.Array([1, 2, 3], na.int32())
#> nanoarrow.Array<int32>[3]
#> 1
#> 2
#> 3

url = "https://github.com/apache/arrow-experiments/raw/main/data/arrow-commits/arrow-commits.arrows"
na.ArrayStream.from_url(url)
#> nanoarrow.ArrayStream<non-nullable struct<commit: string, time: timestamp('us', 'UTC'), files: int3...>
```

Low-level users can use `c_schema()`, `c_array()`, and `c_array_stream()` to interact
with thin wrappers around the Arrow C Data interface structures:

```python
na.c_schema(pa.decimal128(10, 3))
#> <nanoarrow.c_schema.CSchema decimal128(10, 3)>
#> - format: 'd:10,3'
#> - name: ''
#> - flags: 2
#> - metadata: NULL
#> - dictionary: NULL
#> - children[0]:

na.c_array(["one", "two", "three", None], na.string())
#> <nanoarrow.c_array.CArray string>
#> - length: 4
#> - offset: 0
#> - null_count: 1
#> - buffers: (4754305168, 4754307808, 4754310464)
#> - dictionary: NULL
#> - children[0]:
```

All nanoarrow type/array-like objects implement the
[Arrow PyCapsule interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html)
for both producing and consuming and are zero-copy interchangeable with `pyarrow`
objects in many cases:

```python
import pyarrow as pa

pa.field(na.int32())
#> pyarrow.Field<: int32>

na.Schema(pa.string())
#> <Schema> string

pa.array(na.Array([4, 5, 6], na.int32()))
#> <pyarrow.lib.Int32Array object at 0x11b552500>
#> [
#>   4,
#>   5,
#>   6
#> ]

na.Array(pa.array([10, 11, 12]))
#> nanoarrow.Array<int64>[3]
#> 10
#> 11
#> 12
```

For a more detailed tour of the nanoarrow Python bindings, see the
[Getting started in Python guide](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/getting-started/python.html) and the
[Python API reference](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/reference/python/index.html).

### C/C++

The nanoarrow 0.5.0 release includes a number of bugfixes and improvements
to the core C library and C++ helpers.

First, the CMake build system was refactored to enable `FetchContent` to
work in a wider variety of
[develop/build/install scenarios](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/examples/cmake-scenarios). In most cases, CMake-based projects should be able
to add the nanoarrow C library as a dependency with:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
fetchcontent_declare(nanoarrow
                     GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow.git
                     GIT_TAG  apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.5.0
                     GIT_SHALLOW TRUE)
fetchcontent_makeavailable(nanoarrow)

add_executable(some_target ...)
target_link_libraries(some_target nanoarrow::nanoarrow)
```

Projects using the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system can add a `subprojects/nanoarrow.wrap` file with:

```
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow.git
revision = apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.5.0

[provide]
nanoarrow = nanoarrow_dep
```

...and use `dependencies: [nanoarrow_dep]` to add a dependency:

```
nanoarrow_dep = dependency('nanoarrow')
example_exec = executable('some_target',
                          ...,
                          dependencies: [nanoarrow_dep])
```

We are working on adding nanoarrow to the
[wrapdb](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html)
to make it even easier to add nanoarrow as a dependency in projects that
use the Meson build system.

Finally, a set of C++ range/view helpers were added to smooth out some
of more verbose aspects of working with nanoarrow in C++. While the
new helpers are targeted at more than just nanoarrow's tests, they have been
particularly helpful in allowing nanoarrow's tests to be more less repetitive
and more effective. For example, one particularly verbose test was collapsed
to:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock-matchers.h>
#include <nanoarrow/nanoarrow_gtest_util.hpp>
#include <nanoarrow/nanoarrow.hpp>

nanoarrow::UniqueArrayStream array_stream;
// ... populate array_stream
nanoarrow::ViewArrayStream array_stream_view(array_stream.get());

for (ArrowArray& array : array_stream_view) {
  EXPECT_THAT(nanoarrow::ViewArrayAs<int32_t>(&array), ElementsAre(1234));
}

EXPECT_EQ(array_stream_view.count(), 1);
EXPECT_EQ(array_stream_view.code(), NANOARROW_OK);
EXPECT_STREQ(array_stream_view.error()->message, "");
```

See the new section in the
[C++ API reference](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/reference/cpp.html#range-for-utilities) for details.

### R bindings

The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the `nanoarrow` package on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Whereas nanoarrow has had an IPC reader supporting most features of the
IPC streaming format since 0.3.0, the R bindings did not implement bindings
until this release. The 0.5.0 release of the R package includes `read_nanoarrow()`
as an entrypoint to reading streams from various sources including URLs,
filenames, and R connections:

``` r
library(nanoarrow)

url <- "https://github.com/apache/arrow-experiments/raw/main/data/arrow-commits/arrow-commits.arrows"

read_nanoarrow(url) |>
  tibble::as_tibble()
#> # A tibble: 15,487 × 5
#>    commit                                time                files merge message
#>    <chr>                                 <dttm>              <int> <lgl> <chr>

```

In developing the Python bindings, it became clear that a representation of
a Arrow C++'s `ChunkedArray` was an important concept to represent. Whereas
the Python bindings have the `Array` class to provide this structure, the
R bindings had only the `nanoarrow_array` as a thin wrapper around the
Arrow C Data interface. When developing the geospatial extension
[GeoArrow for R](https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow-r), a data structure that
maintained chunked Arrow memory as an R vector was needed as an intermediary
between an Arrow-native source and an R-native destination. This experimental
structure can be created with `as_nanoarrow_vctr()`:

``` r
library(nanoarrow)

array <- as_nanoarrow_array(c("one", "two", "three"))
convert_array(array, nanoarrow_vctr())
#> <nanoarrow_vctr string[3]>
#> [1] "one"   "two"   "three"
```

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

Flight SQL has been extended with a method to get type metadata ([ARROW-15313](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15313)) and column metadata in returned schemas ([ARROW-15314](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15314), [ARROW-16064](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16064)) New documentation is available describing Flight and Flight SQL, along with several Cookbook recipes ([ARROW-14698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14698), [ARROW-16065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16065)).

The C++ libraries now support UCX as a network transport ([ARROW-15706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15706)), and the APIs have been refactored to allow other transports to be implemented ([ARROW-15282](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15282)). UCX support is experimental and still subject to change. Many of the APIs have been refactored to use the `arrow::Result` type, and the original variants have been deprecated ([ARROW-16032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16032)). Support for gRPC >= 1.43 has been added ([ARROW-15551](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15551)).

## C++ notes

### Compute

Arrow C++ can now optionally build with support for the experimental
[Substrait](https://substrait.io/) query representation format ([ARROW-15238](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15238)).

A number of compute kernels operating on temporal data have been added:

* addition, subtraction and multiplication between various temporal types;
* a new "is_dst" function to compute whether the input timestamps fall within
daylight saving time (DST);
* a new "is_leap_year" function to compute whether the input timestamps fall
within a leap year.

It is possible to enable a timezone database on Windows at runtime
by calling the `arrow::Initialize()` function ([ARROW-13168](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13168)).

New hash aggregations are available: "hash_one" to return one value from each
group ([ARROW-13993](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-13993)), and "hash_list" to return all values from each group
([ARROW-15152](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15152)).  Null columns are now supported on the sum, mean and product
hash aggregates ([ARROW-15506](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15506)).  Also, it is now possible to execute hash
"aggregations" with only key columns ([ARROW-15609](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15609)).

A new compute function "map_lookup" allows looking up a given key in a map
array ([ARROW-15089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15089)).

New compute functions "sqrt" and "sqrt_checked" allow extracting the square
root of their input ([ARROW-15614](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15614)).

Casting between two struct types is now possible, assuming the destination field
names all exist in the source struct type ([ARROW-1888](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1888), [ARROW-15643](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15643)).

Optional OpenTelemetry tracing has been added to kernel functions and execution
plan nodes ([ARROW-15061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15061)).

The CMake build option `ARROW_ENGINE` has been renamed to `ARROW_SUBSTRAIT`,
to better reflect its actual effect ([ARROW-16158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16158)).

### CSV

It is now possible to change the field delimiter when writing a CSV file
([ARROW-15672](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15672)).

### Dataset

The ORC dataset scanner now observes the batch size parameter ([ARROW-14153](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14153)).

The dataset layer now supports filename-based partitioning, where the data
files are all laid out in the dataset's base directory, their names prefixed
with the partition values separated by underscore characters ([ARROW-14612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14612)).

Optional OpenTelemetry tracing has been added to the dataset scanner ([ARROW-15067](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15067)).

### Filesystem

It is possible to instantiate a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) filesystem
from a URI, making GCS implicitly usable in the datasets layer ([ARROW-14893](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14893)).
Recognized URI schemes are `gs` and `gcs`.

`FileSystem::DeleteDirContents` can now optionally succeed when the directory
doesn't exist ([ARROW-16159](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16159)).

### IO

It is possible to override the number of IO threads using the
environment variable `ARROW_IO_THREADS` ([ARROW-15941](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15941)).

### IPC

The IPC file reader and writer now allow accessing the custom metadata
associated with record batches ([ARROW-16131](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16131)).

### Miscellaneous

It is possible to enable lightweight memory checks on the standard memory pools
using a dedicated environment variable `ARROW_DEBUG_MEMORY_POOL` ([ARROW-15550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15550)).
These checks are not a replacement for sophisticated checkers such as Address
Sanitizer or Valgrind, but might come up useful if those tools are not
available.

Temporal data is now validated when doing full array validation ([ARROW-10924](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10924)).
The validation catches values not matching the specification (for example,
a time value being outside of the span of one day).

The GDB plugin now attempts to print the data of an array, in addition to its
metadata ([ARROW-15389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15389)).  This only works for primitive datatypes.

Pretty-printing is now shorter and more customizable for nested datatypes
([ARROW-14798](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14798)).

## C# notes

With [.NET Core 2.1 reaching end-of-life](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-august-21-2021) in August 2021, the Apache.Arrow library has been updated to target `netcoreapp3.1` and higher. It still supports `netstandard1.3`, so the library works on .NET Framework. But to get the best performance, using .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, or later is recommended.

## Go notes

### Bug fixes

* parquet_reader / parquet_schema no longer crash ([ARROW-15509](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12303))
* Base64 encoding of origin Arrow schema properly uses padding and decodes both with or without the padding in pqarrow.getOriginSchema ([ARROW-15544](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12679))
* ipc.Writer no longer includes unnecessary offsets when encoding sliced arrays ([ARROW-15715](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12453))
* Use base64.StdEncoding for Arrow Flight Basic Auth middleware for proper encoding/decoding ([ARROW-15772](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12503))
* Fix panic during concurrent compression of ipc body buffers due to negative WaitGroup counter ([ARROW-15792](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12518))
* Fix memory leak in pqarrow.NewColumnWriter with nested structures ([ARROW-15946](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12641))
* ipc.FileReader no longer leaks memory when using ZSTD compression ([ARROW-16163](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12857))

### Enhancements

#### Flight RPC

* *Breaking Change* gRPC version is updated and Flight Server creation has been simplified. Flight servers must now embed flight.BaseFlightServer ([ARROW-15418](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12233))
* You can now provide a full net.Listener as an alternative to just providing an address to bind to when creating a Flight server ([ARROW-16082](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12768))

#### Parquet

* 'unpack_bool', sum_float64, and bitmap handling functions have been given optimized assembly implementation for Arm64 NEON ([ARROW-15440](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12398), [ARROW-15742](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12502), [ARROW-15995](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12687))
* Go Parquet handling has been simplified to only need io.ReadSeeker instead of a ReadAtSeeker interface ([ARROW-15963](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12658))
* BitSetRunReader and helper functions have been lifted to internal/bitutils package to share between arrow and parquet implementations ([ARROW-15950](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12926))
* Parquet Reader now properly obeys the buffer size read property for buffered streams ([ARROW-16187](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12876))
* parquet NewBufferedReader no longer panics ([ARROW-16283](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12960))

#### Arrow

* Go Arrow library now supports Dictionary Arrays ([ARROW-3039](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3039), [ARROW-9378](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9378), [GH-12158](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12158))
* array.ArrayEqual, array.ArrayApproxEqual have been renamed to array.Equal and array.ApproxEqual. Aliases are provided to avoid breaking existing code which will be removed in v9. ([ARROW-5598](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12877))
* Custom cpu discovery package replaced with using golang.org/x/sys/cpu ([ARROW-16193](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12764))
* *Breaking Change* array.Interface, array.Record, array.Table, etc. were deprecated in v7 in favor of arrow.Array, arrow.Record, etc. The deprecated aliases have been removed in v8 ([ARROW-16192](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12960))

#### CI

* staticcheck is now run as part of CI to lint the Go code ([ARROW-15296](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12540))
* Travis builds on Arm64 for Go are no longer allowed to fail ([ARROW-15400](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12214))

## Java notes

* Java 17 is now supported as a target and has been added to tested platforms
* When scanning datasets an `ArrowReader` is now returned, which makes easier to create `VectorSchemaRoot` from it.
* Java Documentation had a overall improvement, with few sections added and most sections rewritten as more clear tutorials
* Overall improvements to FlightSQL support in Java
* [Java Cookbook](https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/java/index.html) is now available

## JavaScript notes

* Tables now allow setting arbitrary symbols, which enables support for passing Arrow tables to Vega. [ARROW-16209](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12907)
* Arrow now supports `tableFromJSON` and struct vectors in `vectorFromArray`. [ARROW-16210](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12908)
* Fixed support for appending null children in a StructBuilder. [ARROW-15705](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/12451)

## Python notes

In general, the Python bindings benefit from improvements in the C++ library
(e.g. new compute functions); see the C++ notes above for additional details.
In addition:

* Tables and Datasets now support the `join` operation to perform `left`, `right`, `full` joins of `inner` or `outer` types. The result of the join operation will be a new table ([ARROW-14293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-14293)). See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/compute.html#table-and-dataset-joins for examples.
* Additional legacy keywords and properties of the `ParquetDataset` class have been deprecated and will issue a warning, in favor of functionality based on the `pyarrow.dataset` functionality ([ARROW-16119](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16119)).
* It is now possible to create references to nested fields in a Table or Dataset using `py.field("a", "b")` ([ARROW-11259](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11259)).
* Docstrings in `Schema`, `ChunkedArray`, `Tensor`, `RecordBatch`, `parquet` and `Table` now include examples on how to use the methods and classes ([ARROW-15367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15367)).
* Reading and writing Parquet files now supports encryption ([ARROW-9947](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9947)). See the [docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html#parquet-modular-encryption-columnar-encryption) for more details.
* Support for `zoneinfo` (Python 3.9+) and `dateutil` timezones in conversion to Arrow data structures ([ARROW-5248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/)).
* Multiple bugfixes and segfaults resolved.

## R notes

This release includes:

 * Support for over 20 additional `lubridate` and `base` date and time functions in Arrow dpylr queries,
 * An API to allow external packages to define custom extension array types and custom conversions into Arrow types,
 * Support for concatenating Arrays, RecordBatches, and Tables, including with `c()`, `rbind()` and `cbind()`.

For more on what’s in the 8.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

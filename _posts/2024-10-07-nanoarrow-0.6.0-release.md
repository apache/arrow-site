The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 114 resolved issues from
10 contributors.

## Release Highlights

- Run End Encoding support
- StringView support
- IPC Write support
- DLPack/device support
- IPC/Device available from CMake/Meson as feature flags

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.6.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

## Breaking Changes

Most changes included in the nanoarrow 0.6.0 release will not break downstream
code; however, two changes with respect to packaging and distribution may require
users to update the code used to bring nanoarrow in as a dependency.

In nanoarrow 0.5.0 and earlier, the bundled single-file amalgamation was included in
the `dist/` subdirectory or could be generated using a specially-crafted CMake
command. The nanoarrow 0.6.0 release removes the pre-compiled includes and migrates
the code used to generate it to Python. This setup is less confusing for contributors
(whose editors would frequently jump into the wrong `nanoarrow.h`) and is a less confusing
use of CMake. Users can generate the `dist/` subdirectory as it previously existed
with:

``` shell
python ci/scripts/bundle.py \
  --source-output-dir=dist \
  --include-output-dir=dist \
  --header-namespace= \
  --with-device \
  --with-ipc \
  --with-testing \
  --with-flatcc
```

Second, the Arrow IPC and ArrowDeviceArray implementations previously lived in the `extensions/`
subdirectory of the repository. This was helpful during the initial development of these
features; however, the nanoarrow 0.6.0 release added the requisite feature coverage and testing
such that the appropriate home for them is now the main `src/` directory. As such, one
can now build nanoarrow with IPC and/or device support using:

``` shell
cmake -S . -B build -DNANOARROW_IPC=ON -DNANOARROW_DEVICE=ON
```

## Features

### Float16, StringView, and REE Support

The nanoarrow 0.6.0 release adds support for Arrow's float16 (half float), string view,
and run-end encoding support. The C library supports building float16 arrays using
`ArrowArrayAppendDouble()` and supports building string view and binary view arrays
using `ArrowArrayAppendString()` and/or `ArrowArrayAppendBytes()` and supports consuming
using `ArrowArrayViewGetStringUnsafe()` and/or `ArrowArrayViewGetBytesUnsafe()`. R and
Python users can request a string view or float16 type when building an array, and
conversion back to R/Python strings is suppored.

``` python
# pip install nanoarrow
# conda install nanoarrow -c conda-forge
import nanoarrow as na

na.Array(["abc", "def", None], na.string_view())
#> nanoarrow.Array<string_view>[3]
#> 'abc'
#> 'def'
#> None
na.Array([1, 2, 3], na.float16())
#> nanoarrow.Array<half_float>[3]
#> 1.0
#> 2.0
#> 3.0
```

``` r
# install.packages("nanoarrow")
library(nanoarrow)

as_nanoarrow_array(c("abc", "def", NA), schema = na_string_view()) |>
  convert_array()
#> [1] "abc" "def" NA
as_nanoarrow_array(c(1, 2, 3), schema = na_half_float()) |>
  convert_array()
#> [1] 1 2 3
```

Creating/consuming run-end encoding arrays by element is not yet
supported in C, R, or Python; however, arrays can be built or consumed by assembling
the correct array/buffer structure in C.

Thank you to [cocoa-xu](https://github.com/cocoa-xu) for adding float16 and run-end encoding
support and thank you to [WillAyd](https://github.com/WillAyd) for adding string view support!

### IPC Write Support

The nanoarrow library has supported reading
[Arrow IPC streams](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)
since 0.4.0; however, could not write streams of its own. The nanoarrow 0.6.0 release adds
support for stream writing from C using the `ArrowIpcWriter` and stream writing
from R and Python:

```python
import io
import nanoarrow as na
from nanoarrow import ipc

out = io.BytesIO()
with ipc.StreamWriter.from_writable(out) as writer:
    writer.write_stream(ipc.InputStream.example())

out.seek(0)
na.ArrayStream.from_readable(out).read_all()
#> nanoarrow.Array<non-nullable struct<some_col: int32>>[3]
#> {'some_col': 1}
#> {'some_col': 2}
#> {'some_col': 3}
```

``` r
library(nanoarrow)

tf <- tempfile()
nycflights13::flights |> write_nanoarrow(tf)

read_nanoarrow(tf) |> tibble::as_tibble()
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 19
#>     year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time
#>    <int> <int> <int>    <int>          <int>     <dbl>    <int>          <int>
#>  1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819
#>  2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830
#>  3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850
#>  4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022
#>  5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837
#>  6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728
#>  7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854
#>  8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723
#>  9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846
#> 10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745
#> # ℹ 336,766 more rows
#> # ℹ 11 more variables: arr_delay <dbl>, carrier <chr>, flight <int>,
#> #   tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>, air_time <dbl>, distance <dbl>,
#> #   hour <dbl>, minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>
```

As a result of the IPC write support, nanoarrow now joins the Arrow IPC integration tests
to ensure compatability across implementations. With the exception of
[arrow-rs due to a bug in the Rust flatbuffers implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5052),
nanoarrow is now tested against all participating Arrow implementations with every commit.

A huge thank you to [bkietz](https://github.com/bkietz) for implementing this support and
the tests (which included multiple bugfixes and identification of inconsistencies of
flatbuffer verification in C, Rust, and C++!).

### DLPack/CUDA Support

The nanoarrow 0.6.0 release includes improved support for the
[Arrow C Device data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html).
In particular, the CUDA device implementation was improved to more efficiently coordinate
synchronization when copying arrays to/from the GPU and migrated to use the driver API
for wider compatibility. The nanoarrow Python bindings have limited support for creating
`ArrowDeviceArray` wrappers that implement the
[`__arrow_c_device_array__` protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html#export-protocol)
from anything that implements DLPack:

``` python
# Currently requires:
# export NANOARROW_PYTHON_CUDA=/usr/local/cuda
# pip install --force-reinstall --no-binary=":all:" nanoarrow
import nanoarrow as na
from nanoarrow import device
import cupy as cp

device.c_device_array(cp.array([1, 2, 3]))
#> <nanoarrow.device.CDeviceArray>
#> - device_type: CUDA <2>
#> - device_id: 0
#> - array: <nanoarrow.c_array.CArray int64>
#>   - length: 3
#>   - offset: 0
#>   - null_count: 0
#>   - buffers: (0, 133980798058496)
#>   - dictionary: NULL
#>   - children[0]:

darray = device.c_device_array(cp.array([1, 2, 3]))
cp.from_dlpack(darray.array.view().buffer(1))
#> array([1, 2, 3])
```

Thank you to [AlenkaF](https://github.com/AlenkaF), [shwina](https://github.com/shwina),
and [danepitkin](https://github.com/danepitkin) for their contributions to and
review of this feature!

### Build System Support for IPC/Device

Lastly, the CMake build system was refactored to enable `FetchContent` to
work in an even wider variety of
[develop/build/install scenarios](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/examples/cmake-scenarios). In most cases, CMake-based projects should be able
to add the nanoarrow C library with device and/or IPC support as a dependency with:

``` cmake
include(FetchContent)

# If required:
# set(NANOARROW_IPC ON)
# set(NANOARROW_DEVICE ON)
fetchcontent_declare(nanoarrow
                     URL "https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=arrow/nanoarrow-0.6.0/apache-arrow-0.6.0.tar.gz")
fetchcontent_makeavailable(nanoarrow)

add_executable(some_target ...)
target_link_libraries(some_target
                      PRIVATE
                      nanoarrow::nanoarrow
                      # If needed
                      # nanoarrow::nanoarrow_ipc
                      # nanoarrow::nanoarrow_device
                      )
```

Linking against nanoarrow installed via `cmake --install` and located
via `find_package()` is also supported.

Users of the Meson build system can install the latest nanoarrow with:

``` shell
mkdir subprojects
meson wrap install nanoarrow
```

...and declared as a dependency with:

``` shell
nanoarrow_dep = dependency('nanoarrow')
example_exec = executable('example_meson_minimal_app',
                          'src/app.cc',
                          dependencies: [nanoarrow_dep])
```

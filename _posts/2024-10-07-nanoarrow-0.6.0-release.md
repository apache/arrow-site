The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 114 resolved issues from
10 contributors.

## Release Highlights

- Run End Encoding support
- StringView support
- IPC Write support
- DLPack/device support
- IPC/Device available from CMake/Meson as feature flags

See the
[Changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.6.0/CHANGELOG.md)
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.

## Breaking Changes

Most changes included in the nanoarrow 0.6.0 release will not break downstream
code; however, several changes in the C library are breaking changes to previous
behaviour.

- Check changelog + revdep ADBC

## Features

### REE Support

- C library only, build by buffer

### StringView Support

- C demo
- Python demo
- R demo

### IPC Write Support

- C demo
- Python demo
- R demo

### DLPack/CUDA Support



### Build System Support for IPC/Device

Lastly, the CMake build system was refactored to enable `FetchContent` to
work in an even wider variety of
[develop/build/install scenarios](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/examples/cmake-scenarios). In most cases, CMake-based projects should be able
to add the nanoarrow C library with device and/or IPC support as a dependency with:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

set(NANOARROW_IPC ON)
set(NANOARROW_DEVICE ON)
fetchcontent_declare(nanoarrow
                     GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow.git
                     GIT_TAG  apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.6.0
                     GIT_SHALLOW TRUE)
fetchcontent_makeavailable(nanoarrow)

add_executable(some_target ...)
target_link_libraries(some_target PRIVATE nanoarrow::nanoarrow_ipc nanoarrow::nanoarrow_device)
```

- Works in Meson, too

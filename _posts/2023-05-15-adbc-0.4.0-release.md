The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.4.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**47
resolved issues**][1] from [**8 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
0.4.0.  The **API specification** is versioned separately and is
at version 1.0.0.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

A Go-based driver for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) was added, along with bindings for Python and R.

The PostgreSQL driver now has much better support for different types, and properly handles NULL values.
It now also implements `AdbcConnectionGetTableSchema`.
All C/C++ components have been consolidated into a single build project, simplifying integration with IDEs.

Several `ArrowBuf` leaks in the Java libraries have been fixed, along with miscellaneous bugs in the JDBC adapter.
There was breaking change in the Java libraries: static driver instances were removed, as this was prone to the aformentioned leaks.
Instead, `AdbcDriver` instances can now be created with a `BufferAllocator`, giving the application control over allocations.

The Python, GLib, and Ruby bindings expose more of the API functions.
The Python bindings are now tested against the [polars](https://www.pola.rs/) dataframe project, which has experimental integration with ADBC.
The release process was fixed to properly upload the Windows Python wheels.
The R bindings now include packages for the PostgreSQL driver.

There is a known issue with the Snowflake driver: it will not build on non-x86_64 (AMD64) platforms, including Linux/macOS arm64/aarch64.
This has already been fixed for the next release.

## Linux packages notes

Azure file system is enabled.

## C Data Interface notes


## Arrow Flight RPC notes

**Flight UCX is deprecated.** We plan to remove this experiment in the next couple of releases.

The Java implementation now transparently handles compressed Arrow data when reading, instead of requiring explicit configuration. (GH-43469)

The Ruby bindings now support implementing DoPut on the server. (GH-43814)

## C++ notes

For C++ notes refer to the full changelog.

### Highlights


### Acero

- Enhanced the row-oriented representation by widening the offset type from 32-bit to 64-bit, resolving crashes and data corruption in aggregation and hash join on large datasets due to offset overflow (GH-43495).
- Improved ordered aggregation performance by reducing complexity from `O(n*m)` to `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` the number of segments in the batch (GH-44052).

### Compute


### Dataset


### Filesystems


### GPU


### IPC


### Parquet


### Substrait


## C# notes

- Partial support has been added for LargeBinary, LargeString and LargeList. The column sizes cannot exceed 2 GB in length. (GH-43266).
- Changes to Flight support were made for better control and compatibility, and to allow Flight Server to be hosted in pre-Kestrel versions of .NET (GH-43907, GH-43672, GH-41347).
- Support has been added for newly-defined types decimal32 and decimal64 (GH-44271).
- The import of sliced arrays through the C Data interface now works correctly. (GH-43267)
## Java notes

**Java 8 is no longer supported.** (GH-38051)

**Gandiva may not work in this release.** For details, please see [GH-43576](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43576).

Basic support for RunEndEncoded was added (GH-39982). The ListView/StringView vector implementations are now more complete, including C Data support (multiple issues).

Several APIs have been updated to accept `long` for addresses in preparation for FFM/large buffer support (GH-43902). We no longer expose `sun.misc.Unsafe` (GH-43479). We no longer ship the `shaded` flight-core JARs (GH-43217).

More options were added to the Dataset ScanOptions API (GH-28866).

## JavaScript notes

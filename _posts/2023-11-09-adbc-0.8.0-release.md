The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.8.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**43
resolved issues**][1] from [**12 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
0.8.0.  The **API specification** is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

C#/.NET has added a BigQuery driver. Also, it now can be used through ADO.NET.

The R bindings now use ADBC 1.1.0, and more packages are now available on
CRAN.

The Snowflake driver now has an option to control whether to return decimal
types or attempt to convert to integers/floats.  The PostgreSQL driver now
uses COPY for bulk ingestion, which Pandas has found is [approximately 35x
faster][pandas-adbc] than their previous method.  The SQLite driver can now
load [extensions][sqlite-extensions] and supports more data types, including
Arrow binary (SQL BLOB), and supports binding some dictionary-encoded types
(which will be unpacked).

## Roadmap

Work continues on improving the existing drivers in terms of supported
Arrow/database types, performance, and so on.

For Java, the minimum JDK version will stay on JDK 8 as long as the Arrow Java
libraries remain on that version.

There are currently no plans for a second API revision. As work progresses
on asynchronous and device-aware APIs in the Arrow ecosystem, ADBC will
eventually be updated to support any new APIs.

## Getting Involved

We welcome questions and contributions from all interested.  Issues
can be filed on [GitHub][4], and questions can be directed to GitHub
or the [Arrow mailing lists][5].

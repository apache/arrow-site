- Added support for copying Arrays and RecordBatches between memory types ([GH-39771](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39771)).

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

- Session variable RPCs were added ([GH-34865](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34865))
- Go: cookies can be copied to another connection to reuse existing credentials ([GH-39837](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39837))

## C++ notes
For C++ notes refer to the full changelog.

### Highlights

- Initial support for the Azure Blob Storage has been added ([GH-18014](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/18014)).
- Arrow C++ can now be built with Emscripten ([GH-37821](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/37821)) which lays the foundation for running Arrow C++ under WASM runtimes and eventually [PyArrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/37822) as well.
- Arrow's filesystem modules have been separated out into individual libraries and this change enables writing and registering custom filesystem implementations ([GH-38309](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38309)).
- Conversion from `Table` and `RecordBatch` to a `Tensor` (not the same as
[tensor extension array](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#official-list))
is being developed. Umbrella issue is created ([GH-40058](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40058))
and issues connected to the `RecordBatch` conversion are included in this release
([GH-40059](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40059),
[GH-40357](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40357),
[GH-40297](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40297),
[GH-40060](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40060),
[GH-40061](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40061) and
[GH-40866](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40866)) which means `RecordBatch` can now be
converted to a column or row-major two-dimensional structure.

### Compute

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a potential crash when accessing the `true_count` property on a BooleanArray ([GH-41016](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41016)).

#### Performance improvements

- Significantly improved performance of the take kernel on certain types of inputs ([GH-40207](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40207)).

#### Enhancements

- Support for casting to and from half-float (float16) has been added ([GH-20213](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20213)).
- Added support for residual predicates to Swiss Join implementation ([GH-20339](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20339)).
- Expanded support to primitive filter implementation for all fixed-width primitive types and take filter implementation for all well-known fixed-width types ([GH-39740](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39740)).
- Added support for calling the `binary_slice` kernel on Fixed-Size Binary Arrays ([GH-39231](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39231)).
- The cast kernel now supports casting from LargeString, Binary, and LargeBinary to Dictionary ([GH-39463](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39463)).
- Fields of different decimal precision can now be used together in arithmetic operations without an explicit cast beforehand. ([GH-40126](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40126)).

### Datasets

- Improved backpressure handling in the Dataset Writer which can significantly reduce memory usage for some use cases ([https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/40722](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/40722)).

### Parquet

- Byte stream split encoding support has been added for FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY, INT32, and INT64 which enables this encoding for half-float (float16) and fixed-width decimal ([GH-39978](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39978)).
- Decoding boolean values has been made faster for a variety of cases ([GH-40872](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40872)).

### Filesystems

#### New Features

- In addition to building the individual filesystem implementations as separate modules, users can now write and register custom filesystem implementations ([GH-38309](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38309)).
- A new environment variable, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, has been added which allows separately overriding the endpoint for S3 operations alone ([GH-38663](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38663)).

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the S3 filesystem implementation that could cause a crash when deleting an object having duplicate forward slashes in its name ([GH-38821](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38821)).
- Fixed a bug where `hash_mean` could silently overflow ([GH-38833](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38833)).

#### Improvements

- The S3 implementation now sets the content-type of directory-like objects to application/x-directory to improve compatibility with other S3 tools ([GH-38794](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38794)).
- Repeated S3Client initialization is now roughly an order of magnitude faster ([GH-40299](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/40299)).
- The MemoryPoolStats implementation has been reworked to re-order loads and stores which may be an improvement for some allocation-heavy, multi-threaded applications ([GH-40783](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40783)).

### Substrait

- Support has been added to Substrait for a variety of Arrow types ([GH-40695](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40695)).
- substrait-cpp has been upgraded to 0.44 ([GH-40695](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40695)).

- Upgraded zstd to 1.5.6 ([GH-40837](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/40837)).
- Upgraded google benchmark to 1.8.3 ([GH-39863](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39863)).
- Upgraded zlib 1.3.1 ([GH-39876](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39876)).
- Various ToString methods now support an optional `show_metadata` argument which will print metadata that may exist in nested types. ([GH-39864](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39864)).

## C# notes
- IPC record batch compression has been implemented [GH-24834](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/24834)
- Optional materialization of C# string arrays is now supported [GH-41047](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41047)

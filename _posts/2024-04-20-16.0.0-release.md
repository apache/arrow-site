## Python notes

Compatibility notes:
* To ensure PyArrow compatibility with NumPy 2.0 umbrella issue has been closed [GH-39532](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39532) with last issues included in 16.0.0 Arrow release ([GH-41098](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41098), [GH-39848](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39848) and [GH-40376](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40376)).
* We no longer use internals to create Block objects and started using new pandas API with pandas version 3 [GH-35081](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35081)
* Pandas compatibility code has been simplified as old pandas and Python versions are not supported anymore [GH-40720](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40720)
* Deprecated `pyarrow.filesystem` legacy implementations have been removed [GH-20127](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20127)

New features:
* Converting Arrow `Table` and `RecordBatch` to a `Tensor` (not the same as [tensor extension array](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#official-list)) is being developed in Arrow C++ with bindings in Python. Umbrella issue: ([GH-40058](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40058)). In current release the option to convert a `RecordBatch` to `Tensor` with `pyarrow.RecordBatch.to_tensor(...)` is added returning a row or column major tensor with an option of writing missing values as `NaN` in the result.
* `ListView` and `LargeListView` array formats are now supported by PyArrow ([GH-39812](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39812), [GH-39855](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39855), [GH-40205](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40205), [GH-41039](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/41039), [GH-40266](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40266))

* Final support for Run-End Encoded arrays in PyArrow has been included (conversion to numpy and pandas [GH-40659](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40659), construction in `pa.array(...)` [GH-40273](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40273))
* `AsofJoinNode` C++ functionality is now exposed in Python as a `join_asof` [GH-34235](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34235)

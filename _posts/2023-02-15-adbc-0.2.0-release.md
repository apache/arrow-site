The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.2.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**34
resolved issues**][1] from [**7 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
0.2.0.  The **API specification** is versioned separately and is
at version 1.0.0.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

An ADBC Flight SQL driver in Go has been added.  This driver has
bindings for C/C++ and Python as well.  This lets us distribute and
update the driver independently of PyArrow, without causing conflicts
in dependencies like Protobuf and gRPC.

The Go database/sql interface now returns standard library `time.Time`
values for Arrow time and date columns.

The PostgreSQL driver has support for more types.

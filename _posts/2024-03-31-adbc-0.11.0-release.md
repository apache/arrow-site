The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.11.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes [**36
resolved issues**][1] from [**11 distinct contributors**][2].

This is a release of the **libraries**, which are at version
0.11.0.  The **API specification** is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Release Highlights

This release includes [NuGet packages][nuget] for C#.

The Flight SQL driver supports the session options and reuse-connection URI
scheme recently added to the protocol.

Go packages now require Go 1.21 or later, as Go 1.20 is out of support.  The
Go drivers now use a common driver framework to make future maintenance
easier.

Python wheels now include debug info to help investigate bug reports.  Also,
users of the DBAPI layer will find that the driver properly reacts to
SIGINT/Control+C in more places.

The Snowflake driver now returns table constraints metadata.

The SQLite driver now supports temporary tables and more ingestion options.

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the v18.0.0 release of
Apache Arrow Go. This release covers 35 resolved issues from
11 contributors.

## Release Highlights

### Move to new Repository

The Apache Arrow Go implementation has been shifted out of the Arrow monorepo
and to its own repository now located at https://github.com/apache/arrow-go.
This will enable fewer major version releases and facilitate more minor
version/patch releases instead as it will detach the version number from the
Arrow C++ and other implementations in the monorepo.

Current users of Arrow Go will want to carefully note the breaking change to
module paths this move causes. To upgrade to Arrow Go v18.0.0, ensure you
properly update all relevant module paths in your `go.mod`, replacing all
instances of `github.com/apache/arrow/go/` with `github.com/apache/arrow-go`.

Existing Go related issues have been moved to the new repository and please file
any new issues on the new repository instead of the Arrow monorepo.

### Go Version

With this release, the minimum Go version is now 1.22.

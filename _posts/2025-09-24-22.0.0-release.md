## Community

Since the 21.0.0 release, Kyle Barron has been invited to be committer.

Matthijs Brobbel, Adam Reeve and Rossi Sun have been joined the
Project Management Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

The first Apache Arrow Summit was held on October 2nd 2025 in Paris, France
as part of [PyData Paris](https://pydata.org/paris2025).
Program details and agenda can be found here: https://www.meetup.com/pydata-paris/events/310646396/

There were around 35 attendees, of which ~20 were existing core developers or PMC members.
The Summit was overwhelmingly described as a success, with a friendly atmosphere between all participants.
Unfortunately, no Audio / Video recording system was available for this event.

## Arrow Flight RPC Notes

Support for dictionary replacement and dictionary encoding has been added to the DoGet and DoExchange methods. ([GH-45056](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45056),[GH-45055](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45055) and [GH-26727](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/26727)).

As part of supporting dictionary replacement we have also exposed the ``ipc::ReadStats`` on the ``FlightStreamReader`` in order to facilitate debugging. ([GH-47422](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/47422))

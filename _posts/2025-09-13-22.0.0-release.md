Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

The first Apache Arrow Summit was held on October 2nd 2025 in Paris, France
as part of [PyData Paris](https://pydata.org/paris2025).
Program details and agenda are here: https://www.meetup.com/pydata-paris/events/310646396/ 

There were around 35 attendees, of which ~20 were existing core developers or PMC members.
The Summit was overwhelmingly described as a success, with a friendly atmosphere between all participants.
Unfortunately, no A/V recording system was available for this event.

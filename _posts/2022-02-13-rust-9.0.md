The Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) has just released version `9.0.2`.

While a major version of this magnitude may shock some in the Rust
community to whom it implies a slow moving 20 year old piece of
software, nothing could be further from the truth!

With regular and predictable bi-weekly releases, the library continues
to evolve rapidly, and `9.0.2` is no exception. Some recent highlights:


# `parquet`: async, performance, safety and nested types

The [parquet `9.0.2`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow/9.0.2) release includes an [`async` reader](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/9.0.2/parquet/src/arrow/async_reader.rs#L21-L75), a long time requested feature. Using the `async`
reader it is now possible to read only the relevant parts of a parquet
file from a networked source such as object storage. Previously the
entire file had to be buffered locally. We are hoping to add an `async`
writer in a future release and would love some
[help](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1269).

It is also significantly faster to read parquet data (up to
[60x](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1180#issuecomment-1018518863)
in some cases) than with previous versions of the `parquet`
crate. Kudos to [tustvold](https://github.com/tustvold) and
[yordan-pavlov](https://github.com/yordan-pavlov) for their
contributions in these areas.

With `8.0.0` and later, the code that reads and writes `RecordBatch`es
to and from Parquet now supports all types, including deeply nested
structs and lists. Thanks [helgikrs](https://github.com/helgikrs) for
cleaning up the last corner cases!

Other notable recent additions to parquet are `UTF-8` validation on
string data for improved security against malicious inputs.

Planned upcoming work includes [pushing more
filtering](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1191) directly
into the parquet scan as well as an `async` writer.


# `arrow`: performance, dyn kernels, and DecimalArray

The [compute](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/compute/index.html)
kernels have been improved significantly in [arrow `9.0.2`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet/9.0.2). Some [filter
benchmarks](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1228#issue-1111889246)
are twice as fast and the SIMD kernels are also [significantly
faster](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1221). Many thanks to
[tustvold](https://github.com/tustvold) and
[jhorstmann](https://github.com/jhorstmann).
[Additional substantial](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1248)
improvements are likely to land in arrow `10.0.0`.

We are working on new set of "dynamic" `dyn_` kernels (for example,
[`eq_dyn`](https://docs.rs/arrow/8.0.0/arrow/compute/kernels/comparison/fn.eq_dyn.html))
that make it easier to invoke the heavily optimized kernels provided
by the `arrow` crate. Work is underway to expand the breadth of types
supported by these new kernels to make them even more useful. Thanks
to [matthewmturner](https://github.com/matthewmturner) and
[viirya](https://github.com/viirya) for their help in this
effort.

While `arrow` has had basic support for `DecimalArray` since version
`3.0.0`, support has been expanded for `Decimal` type in calculation
kernels such as `sort`, `take` and `filter` thanks to some great
contributions from [liukun4515](https://github.com/liukun4515). There
is [ongoing work](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1223) to
improve the API ergonomics and performance of `DecimalArray` as well.

# Security

The `6.4.0` release resolved the last outstanding
[RUSTSEC](https://rustsec.org/)
[advisory](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1131) on the
arrow crate and the `8.0.0` release resolved the last outstanding
known security issues. While these security issues were mostly limited
misuse of the low level "power user" APIs which most users do not (and
should not) be using, it was good to tighten up that area.

Now that `arrow-rs` is releasing major versions every other week, we
are also able to update dependencies at the same pace, helping to
ensure that security fixes upstream can flow more quickly to
downstream projects.

# Final shoutout

# How to Get Involved

If you are interested in contributing to the Rust subproject in Apache Arrow, you can find a list of open issues
suitable for beginners [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
and the full list [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues).

Other ways to get involved include trying out Arrow on some of your data and filing bug reports, and helping to
improve the documentation.

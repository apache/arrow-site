We recently released the 6.0.0 Rust version of Apache Arrow, which 
coincides with the [Arrow 6.0.0 release]({{ site.baseurl }}/6.0.0.html). This 
post highlights some of the improvements in the Rust implementation. The full changelog can be 
found [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/6.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

The Rust Arrow implementation would not be possible without the wonderful work and support of our community, and 
the 6.0.0 release is no exception. It includes 99 commits from 35 individual contributors, many of them with 
their first contribution. Thank you all very much.

# Arrow

Highlighted features and changes between release 5.0.0 and this release are:
1. New MapArray support
2. Add optimized filter kernel for regular expression matching
4. Implement `sort()` for `BinaryArray`
5. Replace `ArrayData::new()` with `ArrayData::try_new()` and `unsafe ArrayData::new_unchecked`
6. Sorting should require less memory and be faster

Of course, this release also contains bug fixes, performance improvements, and improved documentation examples. For the full list of changes, 
please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/6.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

# More Frequent Releases
Arrow releases major versions every three months. The Rust implementation follows this 
major release cycle, and additionally releases minor version updates approximately every other week
to speed the flow of new features and fixes.

You can always find the latest releases on crates.io: [`arrow`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow), [`parquet`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet), 
[`arrow-flight`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight), and [`parquet-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet-derive).

# DataFusion & Ballista
[DataFusion](https://docs.rs/datafusion/) is an in-memory query engine with DataFrame and SQL APIs, built on top of Arrow. 
Ballista is a distributed compute platform. These projects are now in their [own repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion), 
and are no longer released in lock-step with Arrow.

# Highlighted Functionality
The memory required to do sorting has been improve by the pull request resolving issue [553](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/553). 
A demonstration for how to sort follows.
```rust
extern crate arrow;

use arrow::array::{
    Int32Array,
    ArrayRef,
};
use std::sync::Arc;
use arrow::compute::sort;

fn main() {
    
    let array: ArrayRef = Arc::new(Int32Array::from(vec![5, 4, 23, 1, 20, 2]));
    println!("{:?}", array);
    let sorted_array = sort(&array, None).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", sorted_array);
}
```
For further examples, see the [source code](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/arrow/src/compute/kernels/sort.rs).

# Roadmap for 7.0.0 and Beyond
Here are some of the initiatives that contributors are currently working on for future releases:

* Validate arguments to ArrayData::new and null bit buffer and buffers
* add ilike comparitor
* refactor regexp_is_match_utf8_scalar
* add support for float 16
* Updated `UnionArray` support to follow the latest arrow spec

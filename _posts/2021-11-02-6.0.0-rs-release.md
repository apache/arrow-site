We recently released the 6.0.0 Rust version of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) which 
coincides with the [Arrow 6.0.0 release](https://arrow.apache.org/release/6.0.0.html). This 
post highlights some of the improvements in the Rust implementation. The full changelog can be 
found [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/6.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

The Rust Arrow implementation would not be possible without the wonderful work and support of our community, and 
the 6.0.0 release is no exception. It includes 99 commits from 35 individual contributors, many of them with 
their first contribution. Thank you all very much.

# Arrow
Feature-wise, this release adds:
1. To-do
2. To-do

We continue to leverage the Rust ecosystem to deliver reliable and performant code.

Of course, this release also contains bug fixes, performance improvements, and improved documentation examples. For the full list of changes, 
please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/6.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

# Parquet

# More Frequent Releases
Arrow releases major versions every three months. The Rust implementation has been experimenting with releasing minor version updates to 
speed the flow of new features and fixes.

You can always find the latest releases on crates.io: [`arrow`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow), [`parquet`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet), 
[`arrow-flight`](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight), and [`parquet-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/parquet-derive).

# DataFusion & Ballista
[DataFusion](https://docs.rs/datafusion/4.0.0/datafusion/) is an in-memory query engine with DataFrame and SQL APIs, built on top of Arrow. 
Ballista is a distributed compute platform. These projects are now in their [own repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion), 
and are no longer released in lock-step with Arrow. Expect further news in this area soon.

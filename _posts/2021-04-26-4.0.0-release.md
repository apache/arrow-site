## R notes

The `dplyr` interface to Arrow data gained many new features in this release, including support for `mutate()`, `relocate()`, and more. You can also call in `filter()` or `mutate()` over 100 functions supported by the Arrow C++ library, and many string functions are available both by their base R (`grepl()`, `gsub()`, etc.) and `stringr` (`str_detect()`, `str_replace()`) spellings.

Datasets can now read compressed CSVs automatically, and you can also open a dataset that is based on a single file, enabling you to use `write_dataset()` to partition a very large file without having to read the whole file into memory.

For more on what’s in the 4.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 4.0.0 release. This covers
3 months of development work and includes [**711 resolved issues**][1]
from [**114 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 3.0.0 release, Yibo Cai, Ian Cook, and Jonathan Keane
have been invited as committers to Arrow,
and Andrew Lamb and Jorge Leitão have joined the Project Management Committee
(PMC). Thank you for all of your contributions!

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

In Java, applications can now enable zero-copy optimizations when writing
data (ARROW-11066). This potentially breaks source compatibility, so it is
not enabled by default.

Arrow Flight is now packaged for C#/.NET.

## Linux packages notes

There are Linux packages for C++ and C GLib. They were provided by Bintray
but [Bintray is no longer available as of 2021-05-01][5]. They are provided
by Artifactory now. Users needs to change the install instructions because the URL
hsa changed. See [the install page][6] for new instructions. Here is a
summary of needed changes.

For Debian GNU Linux and Ubuntu users:

  * Users need to change the `apache-arrow-archive-keyring` install instruction:
    * Package name is changed to `apache-arrow-apt-source`.
    * Download URL is changed to `https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/...` from `https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/...`.

For CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux users:

  * Users need to change the `apache-arrow-release` install instruction:
    * Download URL is changed to `https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/...` from `https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/...`.

## C++ notes

The Arrow C++ library now includes a [`vcpkg.json`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/vcpkg.json)
manifest file and a new CMake option `-DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=VCPKG` to
simplify installation of dependencies using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
package manager. This provides an alternative means of installing C++ library
dependencies on Linux, macOS, and Windows. See the
[Building Arrow C++]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/developers/cpp/building.html)
and [Developing on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html)
docs pages for details.

The default memory allocator on macOS has been changed from jemalloc to mimalloc,
yielding performance benefits on a range of macro-benchmarks (ARROW-12316).

Non-monotonic dense union offsets are now disallowed as per the Arrow format
specification, and return an error in `Array::ValidateFull` (ARROW-10580).

### Compute layer

Automatic implicit casting in compute kernels (ARROW-8919). For example, for
the addition of two arrays, the arrays are first cast to their common numeric
type instead of erroring when the types are not equal.

Compute functions `quantile` (ARROW-10831) and `power` (ARROW-11070) have been
added for numeric data.

Compute functions for string processing have been added for:

* Trimming characters (ARROW-9128).
* Extracting substrings captured by a regex pattern (`extract_regex`, ARROW-10195).
* Computing UTF8 string lengths (`utf8_length`, ARROW-11693).
* Matching strings against regex pattern (`match_substring_regex`, ARROW-12134).
* Replacing non-overlapping substrings that match a literal pattern or regular
  expression (`replace_substring` and `replace_substring_regex`, ARROW-10306).

It is now possible to sort decimal and fixed-width binary data (ARROW-11662).

The precision of the `sum` kernel was improved (ARROW-11758).

### CSV

A CSV writer has been added (ARROW-2229).

The CSV reader can now infer timestamp columns with fractional seconds (ARROW-12031).

### Dataset

Arrow Datasets received various performance improvements and new
features. Some highlights:

* New columns can be projected from arbitrary expressions at scan time
  (ARROW-11174)
* Read performance was improved for Parquet on high-latency
  filesystems (ARROW-11601) and in general when there are thousands of
  files or more (ARROW-8658)
* Null partition keys can be written (ARROW-10438)
* Compressed CSV files can be read (ARROW-10372)
* Filesystems support async operations (ARROW-10846)
* Usage and API documentation were added (ARROW-11677)

### Files and filesystems

Fixed some rare instances of GZip files could not be read properly (ARROW-12169).

Support for setting S3 proxy parameters has been added (ARROW-8900).

The HDFS filesystem is now able to write more than 2GB of data at a time
(ARROW-11391).

### IPC

The IPC reader now supports reading data with dictionaries shared between
different schema fields (ARROW-11838).

The IPC reader now supports optional endian conversion when receiving IPC
data represented with a different endianness. It is therefore possible to
exchange Arrow data between systems with different endiannesses (ARROW-8797).

The IPC file writer now optionally unifies dictionaries when writing a
file in a single shot, instead of erroring out if unequal dictionaries are
encountered (ARROW-10406).

An interoperability issue with the C# implementation was fixed (ARROW-12100).

### JSON

A possible crash when reading a line-separated JSON file has been fixed (ARROW-12065).

### ORC

The Arrow C++ library now includes an ORC file writer. Hence it is possible
to both read and write ORC files from/to Arrow data.

### Parquet

The Parquet C++ library version is now synced with the Arrow version (ARROW-7830).

Parquet DECIMAL statistics were previously calculated incorrectly, this
has now been fixed (PARQUET-1655).

Initial support for high-level Parquet encryption APIs similar to those
in parquet-mr is available (ARROW-9318).

## C# notes

Arrow Flight is now packaged for C#/.NET.

## Go notes

The go implementation now supports IPC buffer compression

## Java notes

Java now supports IPC buffer compression (ZSTD is recommended as the current performance of LZ4 is quite slow).

## JavaScript notes

* The Arrow JS module is now tree-shakeable.
* Iterating over Tables or Vectors is ~2X faster. [Demo](https://observablehq.com/@domoritz/arrow-js-3-vs-4-iterator)
* The default bundles use modern JS.
## Python notes

- Limited support for writing out CSV files (only types that have cast implementation to String) is now available.
- Writing parquet list types now has the option of enabling the canonical group naming according to the Parquet specification.
- The ORC Writer is now available.

Creating a dataset with `pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset` is now possible from a
Python iterator of record batches (ARROW-10882).
The Dataset interface can now use custom projections using expressions when
scanning (ARROW-11750). The expressions gained basic support for arithmetic
operations (e.g. `ds.field('a') / ds.field('b')`) (ARROW-12058). See
the [Dataset docs][7] for more details.

See the C++ notes above for additional details.

## R notes

The `dplyr` interface to Arrow data gained many new features in this release, including support for `mutate()`, `relocate()`, and more. You can also call in `filter()` or `mutate()` over 100 functions supported by the Arrow C++ library, and many string functions are available both by their base R (`grepl()`, `gsub()`, etc.) and `stringr` (`str_detect()`, `str_replace()`) spellings.

Datasets can now read compressed CSVs automatically, and you can also open a dataset that is based on a single file, enabling you to use `write_dataset()` to partition a very large file without having to read the whole file into memory.

For more on what’s in the 4.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## C GLib and Ruby notes

### C GLib

- `Arrow::SortKey` and `Arrow::SortOptions` are added for accepting Ruby objects as sort key and options
- `ArrowDataset::InMemoryFragment` is added

## Rust notes

This release of Arrow continues to add new features and performance improvements. Much of our time this release was spent hammering out the necessary details so we can release the Rust versions to cargo at a more regular rate. In addition, we welcomed the [Ballista distributed compute project](https://ballistacompute.org/) officially to the fold.

The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 4.0.0 release. This covers
3 months of development work and includes [**711 resolved issues**][1]
from [**114 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 3.0.0 release, Yibo Cai has been invited as a committer to Arrow, and Andrew Lamb and Jorge Leitão have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC). Thank you for all of your contributions!

## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

In Java, applications can now enable zero-copy optimizations when writing data (ARROW-11066). This potentially breaks source compatibility, so it is not enabled by default.

Arrow Flight is now packaged for C#/.NET.

## Linux packages notes

There are Linux packages for C++ and C GLib. They were provided by Bintray but [Bintray will no longer be available on 2021-05-01][5]. They are provided by Artifactory now. Users needs to change install instructions because URL is changed. See [the install document][6] for new instructions. Here is a summary of needed changes.

For Debian GNU Linux and Ubuntu users:

  * Users need to change `apache-arrow-archive-keyring` install instruction:
    * Package name is changed to `apache-arrow-apt-source`.
    * Download URL is changed to `https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/...` from `https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/...`.

For CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux users:

  * Users need to change `apache-arrow-release` install instruction:
    * Download URL is changed to `https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/arrow/...` from `https://apache.bintray.com/arrow/...`.

## C++ notes

The Arrow C++ library now includes a [`vcpkg.json`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/vcpkg.json) manifest file and a new CMake option `-DARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=VCPKG` to simplify installation of dependencies using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager. This provides an alternative means of installing C++ library dependencies on Linux, macOS, and Windows. See the [Building Arrow C++]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/developers/cpp/building.html) and [Developing on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/developers/cpp/windows.html) docs pages for details.


* Parquet library version will now be updated with each release.
* Parquet DECIMAL statistics where previously calculated incorrectly, this has now been fixed.
* The Arrow C++ library now includes an ORC writer. 

## C# notes

## Go notes

The go implementation now supports IPC buffer compression

## Java notes
Java now supports IPC buffer compression (ZSTD is recommended as the current performance of LZ4 is quite slow).

## JavaScript notes
* The Arrow JS module is now tree-shakeable. 
* Iterating over Tables or Vectors is ~2X faster. [Demo](https://observablehq.com/@domoritz/arrow-js-3-vs-4-iterator) 
* The default bundles use modern JS.
## Python notes
- Limited support for writing out CSV files (only types that have cast implementation to String) are now available.
- Writing parquet list types now has the option of enabling the canonical group naming according to the Parquet specification.
- The ORC Writer is now available.

## R notes

The `dplyr` interface to Arrow data gained many new features in this release, including support for `mutate()`, `relocate()`, and more. You can also call in `filter()` or `mutate()` over 100 functions supported by the Arrow C++ library, and many string functions are available both by their base R (`grepl()`, `gsub()`, etc.) and `stringr` (`str_detect()`, `str_replace()`) spellings.

Datasets can now read compressed CSVs automatically, and you can also open a dataset that is based on a single file, enabling you to use `write_dataset()` to partition a very large file without having to read the whole file into memory.

For more on what’s in the 4.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

## Columnar Format Notes

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

In the C++/Python Flight clients, DoAction now properly streams the results, instead of blocking until the call finishes. Applications that did not consume the iterator before should fully consume the result. ([#15069](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15069))

  * Fixed bug where arrays with a zero-case union data type would not be accepted when imported via the C data API [GH-14855](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14855)
  * Fixed bug where case_when could return incorrect values [GH-33382](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33382)

## JavaScript notes

* Bugfixes and dependency updates.
* Arrow now requires BigInt support. [GH-33681](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/33682)

## Python notes

Compatibility notes:

* PyArrow now requires pandas >= 1.0 ([ARROW-18173](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18173))
* The `pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset()` class now by default uses the new Dataset API
  under the hood (`use_legacy_dataset=False`). You can still pass
  `use_legacy_dataset=True` to get the legacy implementation, but this option will be
  removed in a next release
  ([ARROW-16728](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16728)).

New features:

* Added support for the [DataFrame Interchange Protocol](https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html)
  for ``pyarrow.Table`` ([GH-33346](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33346)).
* New kernels: `list_slice()` to slice each list element of a ListArray
  returning a new ListArray ([ARROW-17960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17960)).
* A new `filter()` method on the Dataset class as additional API to filter a Dataset
  before consuming it ([ARROW-16616](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16616)).
* New `sort()` method for (Chunked)Array and `sort_by()` method for RecordBatch,
  providing a convenience on top of the `sort_indices` kernel
  ([GH-14778](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14778)), and a new
  `Dataset.sort_by()` method ([GH-14975](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14975)).

Other improvements:

* Support for custom metadata of record batches in the IPC read and write APIs
  ([ARROW-16430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16430)).
* Support URIs and the `filesystem` parameter in `pyarrow.parquet.ParquetFile`
  ([ARROW-18272](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18272)) and
  `pyarrow.parquet.write_metadata`
  ([ARROW-18225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18225)).
* When writing a dataset to IPC using `pyarrow.dataset.write_dataset()`, you can now
  specify IPC specific options, such as compression
  ([ARROW-17991](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17991))
* The `pyarrow.array()` function now allows to construct a MapArray from a sequence of
  dicts (in addition to a sequence of tuples)
  ([ARROW-17832](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17832)).
* The `struct_field()` kernel now also accepts field names in addition to integer
  indices ([ARROW-17989](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17989)).
* Casting to string is now supported for duration ([ARROW-15822](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15822))
  and decimal ([ARROW-17458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-17458)) types,
  which also means those can now be written to CSV.
* When writing to CSV, you can now specify the quoting style
  ([GH-14755](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14755)).
* The `pyarrow.ipc.read_schema()` function now accepts a Message object
  ([ARROW-18423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18423)).
* The Time32Scalar, Time64Scalar, Date32Scalar and Date64Scalar classes got a `.value`
  attribute to access the underlying integer value, similar to the other date-time
  related scalars ([ARROW-18264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18264))
* Duration type is now supported in the hash kernels like `dictionary_encode`
  ([GH-15226](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/15226)).
* Fix silent overflow when converting `datetime.timedelta` to duration type
  ([ARROW-15026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15026)).

Relevant bug fixes:

* Numpy conversion for ListArray is improved taking into account sliced offset, avoiding
  increased memory usage ([GH-20512](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/20512)
* Fix writing files with multi-byte characters in file name
  ([ARROW-18123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-18123)).

## R notes
* map_batches() is lazy by default; it now returns a RecordBatchReader instead of a list of RecordBatch objects unless lazy = FALSE. [GH-14521](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14521)
* A substantial reorganisation, rewrite of and addition to, many of the vignettes and README. [GH-14514](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/14514)

For more on what’s in the 11.0.0 R package, see the [R changelog][4].

# Getting started

This page collects resources and guides for using Arrow in all of the project's languages.
For reference on official release packages, see the
[install page]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/).

## C

Glib

Separate from the Glib bindings, the Arrow format also defines a C data interface,
which allows zero-copy data sharing inside a single process without any
build-time or link-time dependency requirements. See the
[blog post]({% post_url 2020-05-04-introducing-arrow-c-data-interface %})
to learn more about it.

## C++

See the [install]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/) page for various places to obtain built C++ libraries, or see the developer docs for guidance on [building](http://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html) from source.

To get started using the C++ libraries, see the [user guide](http://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/getting_started.html).

## C#

## Go

## Java

## JavaScript

## MATLAB

## Python

## R

Install the `arrow` package with

```r
install.packages("arrow")
```

See [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/r/#installation) for more options, and for
Linux users, there's a dedicated [installation vignette]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/r/articles/install.html).

The [getting started vignette]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/r/articles/arrow.html) covers many common use cases, and other vignettes cover specific features like [querying datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/r/articles/dataset.html) and [Python interoperability]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/r/articles/python.html)

## Ruby

## Rust

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Apache Arrow PMC is pleased to announce the donation of the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-comet">Comet project</a>,
a native Spark SQL Accelerator built on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion">Apache Arrow DataFusion</a>.</p>

<p>Comet is an Apache Spark plugin that uses Apache Arrow DataFusion to
accelerate Spark workloads. It is designed as a drop-in
replacement for Spark’s JVM based SQL execution engine and offers significant
performance improvements for some workloads as shown below.</p>

    However, the execution is delegated to Comet,
    which is significantly faster and more resource efficient than a JVM based
    implementation.

<p>Comet is one of a growing class of projects that aim to accelerate Spark using
native columnar engines such as the proprietary <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/photon">Databricks Photon Engine</a> and
open source projects <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/projects/gluten.html">Gluten</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids">Spark RAPIDS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kwai/blaze">Blaze</a> (also built using
DataFusion).</p>

<p>Comet was originally implemented at Apple and the engineers who worked on the
project are also significant contributors to Arrow and DataFusion. Bringing 
Comet into the Apache Software Foundation will accelerate its development and 
grow its community of contributors and users.</p>

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.10.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/14"><strong>31
resolved issues</strong></a> from <a href="#contributors"><strong>18 distinct contributors</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is a release of the <strong>libraries</strong>, which are at version
0.10.0.  The <strong>API specification</strong> is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.</p>

<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/apache-arrow-adbc-0.10.0/CHANGELOG.md">complete changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>The BigQuery driver now handles large result sets, and supports passing a
scope when authenticating.  It also has better support for ARRAY types.</p>

<p>The C++ implementation now requires C++17 or later.</p>

<p>The Flight SQL driver now supports the incremental execution feature with
Flight SQL services that implement PollFlightInfo.  Also, it will reuse
credentials/cookies when creating sub-clients to fetch data.</p>

<p>The Go libraries now expose a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Close</code> method on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdbcDatabase</code> structs; this
is a potentially breaking change.</p>

<p>The Java implementation now has Checker Framework nullness annotations.  The
driver manager interface was overhauled; this is a breaking change to the
library APIs.  The Java Flight SQL driver now supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getObjects</code>.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL driver will add the PostgreSQL type name to the field metadata
of columns of NUMERIC type.  Also, it now handles ENUM types.</p>

<p>The Python bindings now return the underlying PyArrow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RecordBatchReader</code> when
requested, instead of the “wrapped” reader, due to a crash.  This means that
callers will not get ADBC-wrapped exceptions from the reader.  Also, Ctrl-C
will now interrupt ADBC operations on the main thread.</p>

<p>The Snowflake driver now has much, much faster bulk ingestion speed as it now
uploads bulk Parquet files instead of using bind parameters.</p>

-->

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.4.0 release of
Apache Arrow nanoarrow. This release covers 46 resolved issues from
5 contributors.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>The primary focus of the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release was testing, stability, and code
quality. Notably, an implementation of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Integration.html#example-c-data-interface">C data interface integration test</a>
protocol was added to ensure data produced or consumed by nanoarrow can be
consumed or produced by other Arrow implementations.</p>

<p>Apache Arrow nanoarrow 0.4.0 also contains experimental <a href="#python-bindings">Python bindings</a>
to the C library for the purposes of community testing and feedback while a more stable
set of bindings is prepared (targeted for 0.5.0).</p>

<p>See the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.4.0/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a>
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h2>

<p>Changes included in the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release will not break most downstream
code; however, several changes in the C library may result in additional compiler
warnings that could cause downstream build failures for projects with strict
compiler warning policies.</p>

<p>First, in debug mode (i.e., when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_DEBUG</code> is defined), an ignored return
value for functions that return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorCode</code> now issues a compiler warning
for compilers that support an “unused result” attribute. Ignoring the return value
of these functions is a common error and return values that are not
equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_OK</code> should be propagated as soon as possible. The C library
provides tools to check return values in a readable way. Notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK()</code> can be used in a wrapper function that also returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorCode</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_THROW_NOT_OK()</code> can be used from C++ code that inclues <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow.hpp</code>
and is prepared to handle exceptions.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_ASSERT_OK()</code> can be used to to check for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_OK</code> only in
debug mode (i.e., silently ignore errors in release mode and will crash in
debug mode with a message indicating the location of the error).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the first or second is preferred. The
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/main/getting-started/cpp.html#arrow-c-data-nanoarrow-interface-basics">Getting Started with nanoarrow in C/C++ tutorial</a>
includes examples and advice for handling errors emanating from the nanoarrow C
library.</p>

<p>Second, in debug mode (i.e., when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_DEBUG</code> is defined), the appropriate
attribute was added to check the format string passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorSet()</code>
against the provided arguments. Correct code will be unaffected by this change;
however, actual arguments that do not match the format string (e.g., an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int64_t</code>
that is passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorSet()</code> with a format string of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"%d"</code>) should be
cast to the appropriate C type (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>) or the format string should be fixed
to support the type of the actual argument (e.g., using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"%" PRId64</code>).</p>

<p>Third, functions in the C library that do not take ownersip of or modify input
are now properly marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayViewGetIntUnsafe()</code>
previously accepted a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct ArrowArrayView*</code> and now accepts a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const struct ArrowArrayView*</code>. This change makes it more difficult to
accidentally modify input intended to be read-only and improves usability
from C++. Downstream projects that get a new warning about discarding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>
qualifier may need to adjust variable declarations or formal parameter types;
however, most projects should be unaffected by this change.</p>

<h3 id="cc">C/C++</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release includes a number of bugfixes and improvements
to the core C library and C++ helpers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An implementation of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Integration.html#example-c-data-interface">C data interface integration test</a>
was added, including a reader/writer for the Arrow integration testing JSON
format. This was used to improve test coverage of the IPC reader and to
add nanoarrow as a participating member of integration testing in the CI
job that runs in the main Arrow repository.</li>
  <li>The C library now supports a wider range of extended compiler warnings to
make it easier to vendor in projects with strict compiler warning policies.</li>
  <li>C++ helpers were improved to support const-correctness. As a result,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueSchema</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueArray</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueArrayView</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueBuffer</code> now
work with a wider variety of C++ wrappers (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unordered_map</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="r-bindings">R bindings</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow</code> package on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>. The 0.4.0 release of the R bindings includes
improvements in type support and stability. Notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation was improved for low-level users of nanoarrow that are producing or
consuming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArray</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowSchema</code>, and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayStream</code> structures
from C or C++ code in other R packages.</li>
  <li>Improved conversion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list()</code>s to support more types when the <strong>arrow</strong> R
package is not available.</li>
  <li>Added more implmentations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as_nanoarrow_array_stream()</code> to support more object
types from the <strong>arrow</strong> R package.</li>
  <li>Added conversion from Arrow integer arrays to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">character()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-bindings">Python bindings</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release is the first release that contains Python bindings to the
nanoarrow C library! These initial Python bindings are experiemntal and are provided
to solicit an initial round of feedback from the Arrow community. Like the nanoarrow
C library and R bindings, it provides tools to facilitate the use of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html">Arrow C Data</a>
and <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html">Arrow C Stream</a>
interfaces.</p>

<p>You can install the initial release of the Python bindings from PyPI. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow</code>
Python package has been submitted to conda-forge and should be available once the
recipe has been reviewed.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install </span>nanoarrow

<p>The initial release of the Python bindings contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repr()</code>s to print out human-readable
representations of structures in the Arrow C Data and Stream interfaces.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">nanoarrow</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">na</span>

- dictionary: NULL
- children[0]:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to Arrow C Data interface wrappers, the initial nanoarrow Python bindings expose
wrappers for a few nanoarrow C library types like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayView</code> that can be used to
interpret the content of the raw structures.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">na</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">c_array_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">one</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">two</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">three</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">]))</span>

  - &lt;string data[11 b] b'onetwothree'&gt;
- dictionary: NULL
- children[0]:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the initial bindings contain a user-facing “data type” class. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Schema</code>, like its
C Data interface counterpart, can represent a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.Schema</code>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.Field</code>, or a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.DataType</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">na</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">int32</span><span class="p">()</span>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Schema(STRUCT, fields=[Schema(INT32, name='col1')])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next release of nanoarrow for Python will include a user-facing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Array</code> class among other
improvements and features based on community feedback! For a more in-depth review of the
initial Python bindings, see the

This release covers 46 resolved issues from 5 contributors. Release Highlights The primary focus of the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release was testing, stability, and code quality. Notably, an implementation of the C data interface integration test protocol was added to ensure data produced or consumed by nanoarrow can be consumed or produced by other Arrow implementations. Apache Arrow nanoarrow 0.4.0 also contains experimental Python bindings to the C library for the purposes of community testing and feedback while a more stable set of bindings is prepared (targeted for 0.5.0). See the Changelog for a detailed list of contributions to this release. Breaking Changes Changes included in the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release will not break most downstream code; however, several changes in the C library may result in additional compiler warnings that could cause downstream build failures for projects with strict compiler warning policies. First, in debug mode (i.e., when NANOARROW_DEBUG is defined), an ignored return value for functions that return ArrowErrorCode now issues a compiler warning for compilers that support an “unused result” attribute. Ignoring the return value of these functions is a common error and return values that are not equal to NANOARROW_OK should be propagated as soon as possible. The C library provides tools to check return values in a readable way. Notably: NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK() can be used in a wrapper function that also returns ArrowErrorCode. NANOARROW_THROW_NOT_OK() can be used from C++ code that inclues nanoarrow.hpp and is prepared to handle exceptions. NANOARROW_ASSERT_OK() can be used to to check for NANOARROW_OK only in debug mode (i.e., silently ignore errors in release mode and will crash in debug mode with a message indicating the location of the error). Of these, the first or second is preferred. The Getting Started with nanoarrow in C/C++ tutorial includes examples and advice for handling errors emanating from the nanoarrow C library. Second, in debug mode (i.e., when NANOARROW_DEBUG is defined), the appropriate attribute was added to check the format string passed to ArrowErrorSet() against the provided arguments. Correct code will be unaffected by this change; however, actual arguments that do not match the format string (e.g., an int64_t that is passed to ArrowErrorSet() with a format string of "%d") should be cast to the appropriate C type (e.g., int) or the format string should be fixed to support the type of the actual argument (e.g., using "%" PRId64). Third, functions in the C library that do not take ownersip of or modify input are now properly marked as const. For example, ArrowArrayViewGetIntUnsafe() previously accepted a struct ArrowArrayView* and now accepts a const struct ArrowArrayView*. This change makes it more difficult to accidentally modify input intended to be read-only and improves usability from C++. Downstream projects that get a new warning about discarding a const qualifier may need to adjust variable declarations or formal parameter types; however, most projects should be unaffected by this change. C/C++ The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release includes a number of bugfixes and improvements to the core C library and C++ helpers. An implementation of the C data interface integration test was added, including a reader/writer for the Arrow integration testing JSON format. This was used to improve test coverage of the IPC reader and to add nanoarrow as a participating member of integration testing in the CI job that runs in the main Arrow repository. The C library now supports a wider range of extended compiler warnings to make it easier to vendor in projects with strict compiler warning policies. C++ helpers were improved to support const-correctness. As a result, the UniqueSchema, UniqueArray, UniqueArrayView, and UniqueBuffer now work with a wider variety of C++ wrappers (e.g., std::unordered_map). R bindings The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the nanoarrow package on CRAN. The 0.4.0 release of the R bindings includes improvements in type support and stability. Notably: Documentation was improved for low-level users of nanoarrow that are producing or consuming ArrowArray, ArrowSchema, and/or ArrowArrayStream structures from C or C++ code in other R packages. Improved conversion of list()s to support more types when the arrow R package is not available. Added more implmentations of as_nanoarrow_array_stream() to support more object types from the arrow R package. Added conversion from Arrow integer arrays to character(). Python bindings The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release is the first release that contains Python bindings to the nanoarrow C library! These initial Python bindings are experiemntal and are provided to solicit an initial round of feedback from the Arrow community. Like the nanoarrow C library and R bindings, it provides tools to facilitate the use of the Arrow C Data and Arrow C Stream interfaces. You can install the initial release of the Python bindings from PyPI. The nanoarrow Python package has been submitted to conda-forge and should be available once the recipe has been reviewed. pip install nanoarrow The initial release of the Python bindings contain repr()s to print out human-readable representations of structures in the Arrow C Data and Stream interfaces. import nanoarrow as na import pyarrow as pa na.c_schema(pa.decimal128(10, 3)) &lt;nanoarrow.c_lib.CSchema decimal128(10, 3)&gt; - format: 'd:10,3' - name: '' - flags: 2 - metadata: NULL - dictionary: NULL - children[0]: na.c_array(pa.array(["one", "two", "three", None])) &lt;nanoarrow.c_lib.CArray string&gt; - length: 4 - offset: 0 - null_count: 1 - buffers: (2939032895680, 2939032895616, 2939032895744) - dictionary: NULL - children[0]: In addition to Arrow C Data interface wrappers, the initial nanoarrow Python bindings expose wrappers for a few nanoarrow C library types like the ArrowArrayView that can be used to interpret the content of the raw structures. na.c_array_view(pa.array(["one", "two", "three", None])) &lt;nanoarrow.c_lib.CArrayView&gt; - storage_type: 'string' - length: 4 - offset: 0 - null_count: 1 - buffers[3]: - &lt;bool validity[1 b] 11100000&gt; - &lt;int32 data_offset[20 b] 0 3 6 11 11&gt; - &lt;string data[11 b] b'onetwothree'&gt; - dictionary: NULL - children[0]: Finally, the initial bindings contain a user-facing “data type” class. The Schema, like its C Data interface counterpart, can represent a pyarrow.Schema, a pyarrow.Field, or a pyarrow.DataType. na.int32() Schema(INT32) na.struct({"col1": na.int32()}) Schema(STRUCT, fields=[Schema(INT32, name='col1')]) The next release of nanoarrow for Python will include a user-facing Array class among other improvements and features based on community feedback! For a more in-depth review of the initial Python bindings, see the Getting started in Python guide and the Python API reference Contributors This release consists of contributions from 4 contributors in addition to the invaluable advice and support of the Apache Arrow developer mailing list. $ git shortlog -sn 798a1b8f096c84e2b6f887427649f1cb496412b2..apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.4.0 | grep -v "GitHub Actions" 35 Dewey Dunnington 3 William Ayd 2 Dirk Eddelbuettel 2 Joris Van den Bossche 1 eitsupi]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_horizontal_black-txt_white-bg.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_horizontal_black-txt_white-bg.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Apache Arrow 15.0.0 Release</title><link href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/21/15.0.0-release/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apache Arrow 15.0.0 Release" /><published>2024-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/21/15.0.0-release</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/21/15.0.0-release/"><![CDATA[<!--

This covers over 3 months of development work and includes 344 resolved issues on 536 distinct commits from 101 distinct contributors. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the complete changelog. Community Since the 14.0.0 release, Curt Hagenlocher, Xuwei Fu, James Duong and Felipe Oliveira Carvalho have been invited to be committers. Jonathan Keane and Raúl Cumplido have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC). As per our tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year Andy Grove was elected as the new PMC chair and VP. Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! C Data Interface notes New format strings have been added for ListView, LargeListView, BinaryView and StringView array types. Arrow Flight RPC notes Flight SQL is now considered stable (GH-39037). The Flight SQL specification was clarified regarding how the result set schema of a prepared statement is affected by bound parameters (GH-37061). The JDBC Arrow Flight SQL driver now supports mTLS authentication (GH-38460) and bind parameters (GH-33475), follows the Flight RPC spec when fetching data (GH-34532), and can reuse credentials across metadata and data connections (GH-38576). On macOS it will also use the system keychain to be consistent with other platforms (GH-39014). Applications can also retrieve the underlying Flight RPC metadata from the JDBC driver (GH-38024, GH-38022). C++ notes For C++ notes refer to the full changelog. Parquet New features: Support row group filtering for nested paths for C++ and Parquet (GH-39064) Implement Parquet Float16 logical type (GH-36036) Expose sorting_columns in RowGroupMetaData for Parquet files (GH-35331) Support decompressing concatenated gzip members (stream) (GH-38271) API change: Move EstimatedBufferedValueBytes from TypedColumnWriter to ColumnWriter (GH-38887) Change parquet TypedComparator operation to const methods (GH-38874) Remove deprecated AppendRowGroup(int64_t num_rows) (GH-39208) Add api to get RecordReader from RowGroupReader (GH-37002) Bug fixes: Add more closed file checks for ParquetFileWriter to Prevent from used-after-close (GH-38390) Performance enhancement: Faster Scalar BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT encoding/decoding (GH-38542) Faster reading Parquet FLBA (GH-39124, GH-39413) Using bloom_filter_length in parquet 2.10 to optimize bloom filter read (GH-38860) Miscellaneous Upgrade ORC to 1.9.2 (GH-39340) C# notes Removal of build targets: Remove out-of-support versions of .NET and update C# README GH-31579 New features: Better support for decimal values which exceed the range of the BCL’s System.Decimal GH-38351, GH-38483 Expose ArrayDataConcentrator.Concatenate publicly GH-38153 Add ToString methods to Arrow classes GH-36566 Implement common interfaces for structure arrays and record batches GH-38757 Make primitive arrays support IReadOnlyList&lt;T?&gt; GH-38348, GH-39223 Add ToList to Decimal128Array and Decimal256Array GH-37359 Support additional types Interval, Utf8View, BinaryView and ListView GH-38316, GH-39341 Support creating FlightClient with Grpc.Core.Channel GH-39335 Fixes and improved compatibility: Make dictionaries in file and memory implementations work correctly and support integration tests GH-32662 Support blank column names and enable more integration tests GH-36588 Go Notes Bug Fixes Arrow Ensured reliability of AuthenticateBasicToken behind proxies (GH-38198) Ensured release callback is properly called on C Data imported arrays/batches (GH-38281) Fixed rounding errors in decimal256 string functions (GH-38395) Added ValueLen to Binary and String array interface (GH-38458) Fixed Decimal128 rounding issues (GH-38477) Fixed memory leak in IPC LZ4 decompressor (GH-38728) Addressed Data race in GetToTimeFunc for fixed timestamp data types (GH-38795) Fixed “index out of range” error for empty resultsets of FlightSQL driver (GH-39238) Parquet Fixed issue with max definition levels when writing a Parquet file under certain circumstances (GH-38503) File writer now properly tracks the number of rows written beyond the last row group (GH-38516) Enhancements Arrow Added an Avro OCF reader for converting Avro files directly to Arrow record batches (GH-36760) Added support for StringView (GH-38718) and C Data ABI StringViews (GH-39013) GC Checks were enabled for CI running integration tests (GH-38824) Parquet Implemented Float16 logical type for Parquet files (GH-37582) Added proper boolean RLE encoding/decoding (GH-38462) Bug Fixes Enhancements Java notes We expect a breaking change in the next release, Arrow 16.0.0. Support for Java 9 modules is coming, but that will require changing the JVM flags used to launch your application (GH-38998). Arrow 15.0.0 is not affected. A bill-of-materials (BOM) package was added to make it easier to depend on multiple Arrow libraries (GH-38264). The JDBC adapter (separate from the JDBC driver) now supports 256-bit decimals (GH-39484) and throws more informative exceptions (GH-39355). Various improvements were made to utilities for working with vectors (GH-38662, GH-38614, GH-38511, GH-38254, GH-38246). JavaScript notes This release comes with new features and APIs.

New features: PyArrow version 14.0.0 included a new specification for Arrow PyCapsules and related dunder methods GH-35531 and now a public RecordBatchReader constructor from stream object implementing the PyCapsule Protocol has been added GH-[39217](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39217) together with some additional documentation GH-[39196](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39196). DLPack protocol support (producer) was added to the Arrow C++ and is exposed in Python through __dlpack__ and __dlpack_device__ dunder methods GH-33984. Python now exposes enabling CRC checksum for read and write operations in Paquet GH-37242. CRC checksum are optional and can detect data corruption. CacheOptions are now configurable from Python as part of the pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFragmentScanOptions GH-36441. Parquet metadata to indicate sort order of the data are now exposed in RowGroupMetaData GH-35331. Parquet Support write and validate Page CRC (GH-37242) Other improvements: Append parameter from FileOutputStream is exposed for the OSFile class GH-38857.

No-op kernel is added for dictionary_encode(dictionary) GH-34890. PrettyPrint for Timestamp type now adds “Z” at the end of the print string when tz is defined in order to add minimum information about the values being stored in UTC GH-30117. R notes New features: Bindings for base::prod have been added so you can now use it in your dplyr pipelines (i.e., tbl |&gt; summarize(prod(col))) without having to pull the data into R GH-38601. Calling dimnames or colnames on Dataset objects now returns a useful result rather than just NULL GH-38377. The code() method on Schema objects now takes an optional namespace argument which, when TRUE, prefixes names with arrow:: which makes the output more portable GH-38144. Other improvements: To make debugging problems easier when using arrow with AWS S3 (e..g, s3_bucket, S3FileSystem), the debug log level for S3 can be set with the AWS_S3_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. See ?S3FileSystem for more information. GH-38267 An error is now thrown instead of warning and pulling the data into R when any of sub, gsub, stringr::str_replace, stringr::str_replace_all are passed a length &gt; 1 vector of values in pattern GH-39219.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>We recently <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/34.0.0">released DataFusion 34.0.0</a>. This blog highlights some of the major
improvements since we <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/06/24/datafusion-25.0.0/.">released DataFusion 26.0.0</a> (spoiler alert there are many)
and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months.</p>

<p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/">Apache Arrow DataFusion</a> is an extensible query engine, written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, that
uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals">DataFusion’s primary design
goal</a> is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/">dataframe library</a> and
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html">command line SQL tool</a>.</p>

<p>This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future
updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/6475">graduate
to a top level project</a> (Apache Arrow DataFusion → Apache DataFusion!) which
will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/8522">first
DataFusion in person meetup</a> is planned for March 2024.</p>

<p>DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a
community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as
individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">26.0.0</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">34.0.0</code>, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a
thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517
of them.
You can find a list of all changes in the detailed <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/datafusion/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>

<h1 id="new-features-">New Features ✨</h1>

<h2 id="dml--insert--creating-files">DML / Insert / Creating Files</h2>

<p>DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple
files, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parquet</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSV</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARROW</code> and user defined formats.
<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7655">Benchmark results</a> show improvements up to 5x in some cases.</p>

<p>Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any <a href="https://docs.rs/object_store/0.9.0/object_store/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObjectStore</code></a>
implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local
files, and user defined implementations. While reading from <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/listing/struct.ListingTable.html#features">hive style
partitioned tables</a> has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such
tables as well.</p>

<p>For example, to write to a local file:</p>

This blog highlights some of the major improvements since we released DataFusion 26.0.0 (spoiler alert there are many) and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months. Apache Arrow DataFusion is an extensible query engine, written in Rust, that uses Apache Arrow as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries, machine learning and streaming applications. While DataFusion’s primary design goal is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a dataframe library and command line SQL tool. This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to graduate to a top level project (Apache Arrow DataFusion → Apache DataFusion!) which will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our first DataFusion in person meetup is planned for March 2024. DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between 26.0.0 and 34.0.0, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517 of them. You can find a list of all changes in the detailed CHANGELOG. Improved Performance 🚀 Performance is a key feature of DataFusion, DataFusion is more than 2x faster on ClickBench compared to version 25.0.0, as shown below: Figure 1: Performance improvement between 25.0.0 and 34.0.0 on ClickBench. Note that DataFusion 25.0.0, could not run several queries due to unsupported SQL (Q9, Q11, Q12, Q14) or memory requirements (Q33). Figure 2: Total query runtime for DataFusion 34.0.0 and DataFusion 25.0.0. Here are some specific enhancements we have made to improve performance: 2-3x better aggregation performance with many distinct groups Partially ordered grouping / streaming grouping Specialized operator for “TopK” ORDER BY LIMIT XXX Specialized operator for min(col) GROUP BY .. ORDER by min(col) LIMIT XXX Improved join performance Eliminate redundant sorting with sort order aware optimizers New Features ✨ DML / Insert / Creating Files DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple files, using Parquet, CSV, JSON, ARROW and user defined formats. Benchmark results show improvements up to 5x in some cases. Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any ObjectStore implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local files, and user defined implementations. While reading from hive style partitioned tables has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such tables as well. For example, to write to a local file: ❯ CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE awesome_table(x INT) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '/tmp/my_awesome_table'; 0 rows in set. Query took 0.003 seconds. ❯ INSERT INTO awesome_table SELECT x * 10 FROM my_source_table; +-------+ | count | +-------+ | 3 | +-------+ 1 row in set. Query took 0.024 seconds. You can also write to files with the COPY, similarly to DuckDB’s COPY: ❯ COPY (SELECT x + 1 FROM my_source_table) TO '/tmp/output.json'; +-------+ | count | +-------+ | 3 | +-------+ 1 row in set. Query took 0.014 seconds. $ cat /tmp/output.json {"x":1} {"x":2} {"x":3} Improved STRUCT and ARRAY support DataFusion 34.0.0 has much improved STRUCT and ARRAY support, including a full range of struct functions and array functions. For example, you can now use [] syntax and array_length to access and inspect arrays: ❯ SELECT column1, column1[1] AS first_element, array_length(column1) AS len FROM my_table; +-----------+---------------+-----+ | column1 | first_element | len | +-----------+---------------+-----+ | [1, 2, 3] | 1 | 3 | | [2] | 2 | 1 | | [4, 5] | 4 | 2 | +-----------+---------------+-----+ ❯ SELECT column1, column1['c0'] FROM my_table; +------------------+----------------------+ | column1 | my_table.column1[c0] | +------------------+----------------------+ | {c0: foo, c1: 1} | foo | | {c0: bar, c1: 2} | bar | +------------------+----------------------+ 2 rows in set. Query took 0.002 seconds. Other Features Other notable features include: Support aggregating datasets that exceed memory size, with group by spill to disk All operators now track and limit their memory consumption, including Joins Building Systems is Easier with DataFusion 🛠️ Documentation It is easier than ever to get started using DataFusion with the new Library Users Guide as well as significantly improved the API documentation. User Defined Window and Table Functions In addition to DataFusion’s User Defined Scalar Functions, and User Defined Aggregate Functions, DataFusion now supports User Defined Window Functions and User Defined Table Functions. For example, the datafusion-cli implements a DuckDB style parquet_metadata function as a user defined table function (source code here): ❯ SELECT path_in_schema, row_group_id, row_group_num_rows, stats_min, stats_max, total_compressed_size FROM parquet_metadata('hits.parquet') WHERE path_in_schema = '"WatchID"' LIMIT 3; +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ | path_in_schema | row_group_id | row_group_num_rows | stats_min | stats_max | total_compressed_size | +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ | "WatchID" | 0 | 450560 | 4611687214012840539 | 9223369186199968220 | 3883759 | | "WatchID" | 1 | 612174 | 4611689135232456464 | 9223371478009085789 | 5176803 | | "WatchID" | 2 | 344064 | 4611692774829951781 | 9223363791697310021 | 3031680 | +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ 3 rows in set.

DLPack protocol support (producer) was added to the Arrow C++ and is exposed in Python through __dlpack__ and __dlpack_device__ dunder methods GH-33984. Python now exposes enabling CRC checksum for read and write operations in Paquet GH-37242. CRC checksum are optional and can detect data corruption. CacheOptions are now configurable from Python as part of the pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFragmentScanOptions GH-36441. Parquet metadata to indicate sort order of the data are now exposed in RowGroupMetaData GH-35331. Parquet Support write and validate Page CRC (GH-37242) Other improvements: Append parameter from FileOutputStream is exposed for the OSFile class GH-38857. File size can be passed to make_fragment in the pyarrow datasets (pyarrow.dataset.FileFormatand pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat) GH-37857. Support for mask parameter is added to FixedSizeListArray.from_arrays GH-34316 to/from_struct_array are added to the pyarrow.Table class GH-33500. GIL is released in .nbytes which is improving performance when calculating the data size GH-39096. Usage of pandas internals DatetimeTZBlock has been removed GH-38341. DataType instance can be passed to MapType.from_arrays constructor GH-39515. Relevant bug fixes: S3FileSystem equals None segfault has been fixed GH-38535. No-op kernel is added for dictionary_encode(dictionary) GH-34890. PrettyPrint for Timestamp type now adds “Z” at the end of the print string when tz is defined in order to add minimum information about the values being stored in UTC GH-30117. R notes New features: Bindings for base::prod have been added so you can now use it in your dplyr pipelines (i.e., tbl |&gt; summarize(prod(col))) without having to pull the data into R GH-38601. Calling dimnames or colnames on Dataset objects now returns a useful result rather than just NULL GH-38377. The code() method on Schema objects now takes an optional namespace argument which, when TRUE, prefixes names with arrow:: which makes the output more portable GH-38144. Other improvements: To make debugging problems easier when using arrow with AWS S3 (e..g, s3_bucket, S3FileSystem), the debug log level for S3 can be set with the AWS_S3_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. See ?S3FileSystem for more information. GH-38267 An error is now thrown instead of warning and pulling the data into R when any of sub, gsub, stringr::str_replace, stringr::str_replace_all are passed a length &gt; 1 vector of values in pattern GH-39219. Missing documentation was added to ?open_dataset documenting how to use the ND-JSON support added in arrow 13.0.0 GH-38258. Using arrow with duckdb (i.e., to_duckdb()) no longer results in warnings when quitting your R session. GH-38495 For more on what’s in the 15.0.0 R package, see the R changelog. Ruby and C GLib notes Ruby Add Arrow::Table#each_raw_record and Arrow::RecordBatch#each_raw_record (GH-37137, GH-37600) C GLib Follow C++ changes. Rust notes The Rust projects have moved to separate repositories outside the main Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Rust implementation, see the latest Arrow Rust changelog.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_horizontal_black-txt_white-bg.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_horizontal_black-txt_white-bg.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Apache Arrow ADBC 0.9.0 (Libraries) Release</title><link href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/08/adbc-0.9.0-release/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apache Arrow ADBC 0.9.0 (Libraries) Release" /><published>2024-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/08/adbc-0.9.0-release</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/01/08/adbc-0.9.0-release/"><![CDATA[<!--

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.9.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/13"><strong>34
resolved issues</strong></a> from <a href="#contributors"><strong>16 distinct contributors</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is a release of the <strong>libraries</strong>, which are at version
0.9.0.  The <strong>API specification</strong> is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.</p>

<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/apache-arrow-adbc-0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md">complete changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>The C#/.NET implementation is gearing up for a proper release and has had
various bugfixes in the core libraries, the drivers, and the ADO.NET wrapper.</p>

<p>The Go implementation now supports executing more methods (like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ConnectionCommit</code>) when importing a native C/C++ driver.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL driver can now write decimal values and dictionary-encoded
string/bytestring.  Also, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdbcConnectionGetTableSchema</code> was fixed to handle
the catalog and schema parameters correctly, and the driver now tries to
provide a row count for non-select queries.</p>

<p>The Python bindings now accept a PyArrow Dataset as a data source for bulk
ingestion.  The new <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html">PyCapsule interface</a> is supported.  It is
possible to build the Python packages via CMake, which simplifies handling the
mixed-C++-and-Python builds.</p>

<p>The R bindings reference-count objects to try to detect improper usage and
avoid crashes.</p>

<p>The Snowflake driver properly handles escaping and case sensitivity in various
metadata methods.  It also now supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatementExecuteSchema</code>.</p>

<p>The Javadoc API reference is now included in the documentation.</p>

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 14.0.1 release of Apache Arrow.</p>

<p>This release contains a single security fix for PyArrow. Other implementations
are unchanged.</p>

<p>It is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is
recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements
to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. Binary packages are available on PyPI and conda-forge.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow-hotfix</code>
that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions.
See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/">usage instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in PyArrow versions
0.14.0 to 14.0.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable
if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources
(for example user-supplied input files).</p>

<p>This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.</p>
